  "Another great feature is that you can change the appearance of the numbers that display while dialing a phone number.Thanks Verizon!Works but has major flaws.The battery ships with a wrong door, that actually blocks the built in camera.The others ultimately ended up in non-salvageable condition.This particular case is well made, better than some of the others I've used.After all that, including the waiting, I was informed it was not in stock.It folds up nicely and fits in a shirt pocket without being obtrusive.Easy to use.Press twice to redial the last number you called.The phone itself failed after about 10 months.Worth every bit of the $2.97 that I paid for this thing.Other than that one complaint, I think the Treo is a real step forward.They were not super helpful.Doesn't do the job."
