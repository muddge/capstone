  'Bought this blu-tooth to replace another that was uncomfortable.It fits the razr quite well.After reading the first review, I emailed customer service to find out of the description was accurate BEFORE I ordered.Hence, we would not be able to apply any credits against the roaming charges.A camera I might play around with when bored.The rest of the time, I am around big cities and strong digital network presence.This version was brand new in box.I\'m still a little salty about spending nearly a day and $10 at UPS to fix this problem.Brilliant but flawed.The motorola branded usb cable which shipped with the software was malformed at the mini USB end and would not fit the phone\'s usb port easily.I just started using the phone for wmv playback since my iPod broke.I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"'
