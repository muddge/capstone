  "Good design, but doesn't work with Nokia 3650.Expensive.Full user opinionYes it's expensive but this gadget does it all.Screen's big and easy to read.Does what it needs to.I purchased this headset so I could use it with my Motorola v551.Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear."
