  'Good thing I did\'nt spend alot of money on this product.Should have had better info from the phone company.Not your fault.Verizon salesperson says this is due to "poor handling" on our part.Works great with Jawbone Era.It is not the best looking, but the design distributes the weight evenly across your entire ear, not just the top.S9 Bluetooth Headphones.It\'s a cell phone battery.I bought it a week ago.I hardly use my phone for crying out loud!DELIVERY was GREAT!Why can\'t Motorola make one for the V600 like they did for the T720?Great for the price.Or if you\'re trying to dig it out of your pocket, you accidentally hang up or ignore the call.This headset has no volume control.I guess it works fine in this capacity - but is just too flimsy for everday use.As previous reviewers have mentioned, it gets to be a chore to carry around a PDA, iPod, cell phone, camera, etc.Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.'
