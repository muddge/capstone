  "Clarity is second to none and there is no echo.It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.Now the bad.When I search Nokia's website there inn't a NOKIA BLD-3R battery, only a NOKIA BLD-3.My family has four of these phones on a two year plan, purchased new.It attracted every piece of dust or dirt it came in contact with.The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset."
