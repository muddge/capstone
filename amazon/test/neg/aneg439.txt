  'Buyer Beware!.Best Bluetooth."I say:CACA!This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again.The Samsung A-950 is not a good choice to make despite what others are saying.Initially there was some concern as to whether or not the Flexicase would interfere with thumbing, but no problems with that so far.It was in a plain white box with bot a T603 and T605 label and the unit was clearly marked T603.I\'m glad I rejected the opinion of the reviewer who said it was too bulky and that it stuck out too far.It is a mystery each day how the phone will respond to the owner\'s touch.Does not work with Blackberry Pearl.Plus, the anti-noise technology doesn\'t really work.The phone itself is good, but certain features make it VERY annoying.Dont do it.These made the WEP-200 bearable to wear all day.The item arrived fast--within 6 days-- and worked fine.Total frustration & a waste of money.In that respect it is a great phone.I have enjoyed this product every much.I couldn\'t hear anyone and they couldn\'t hear me, it wound up in the trash.This ribbon cable in turn activates the screen when the phone is slid open (or closes is when slid shut).This phone sucks!.The extended battery is wonderful and the price was great!!!Nothing by dead silence.It keeps turning off!.It was heavily distorted through the audio system.It\'s a phone with a PDA or vice-verce.Click Text Message"".9."This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.'
