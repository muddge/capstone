  "Don't buy for KRZR K1m.Maybe it's just the Creative product that cuses the problem?Mine has a sync button.They shipped to me a Monster RadioPlay 250.Since I bought this, I rarely use the headset to talk with.logitech replaced it with this one 12/06.Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying."
