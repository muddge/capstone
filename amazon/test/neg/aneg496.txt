  "Headset does not work with KRZR K1M.... I purchased these to work a KRZR K1M and both sets of headphones did not work.FYI, you can take your old and new phone to a Cingular store and they can tansfer your address book over via the SIM card.I don't know how I ever thought corded headsets were great.This headset is great.The color is good.Arrived OK...and it works!Bad Experience Here.Motorola V600 Problems.Just looks fancy, other than that.... I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone.It is so annoying.The initialization time takes FOREVER!The Q has great functionality and a very well designed keyboard, but every single positive attribute of this device is far - far!SideKick 2 is a bad phone.Not enough volume."
