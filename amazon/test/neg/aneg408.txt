  'After this month-long reparte with the J.D.Not too bad, I can still use the handset (Motorola E815) to switch between calls.Power button is TINY.I choose this because i liked the disign and i thought motorola made good products.The battery life is about 2-3x the life of the battery that it is replacing, and as best I can remember about the same as the phone when new.My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap.The commercials are the most misleading.'
