  'And thas about it.It\'s not the perfect phone.Lucky....I guess.It also constantly repeats, "Command not recognized...." or it would ask, "Did you say?SolidGreat.And while you can shut off the flashing blue light, you can\'t do so while you are already on a call.If not, it displays the caller id info.5.So you can only control the positioning one dimensionally.My aim was to find a small, sleek, simple/contemporary looking phone.This product did the trick, came with all the necessary chargers, and data cable needed to get the lg scoop connected to my computer.VERY DISAPPOINTED.'
