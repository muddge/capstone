  'As soon as I am in a calm and unhurried mood I will try that option and update this review.I am currently fighting w/ nokia so I can have them send me a new piece.I do know that if the phone is resting on a spot and isnt touched the connection remains.I have not tried the other "new" battery, but it was completely dead when it arrived.The new Blackberry has accomplished what they set out to do from the begining.i used this product on a Blackjack II screen that was covered in cloudy patches of scratches.I use it for work, and when I have to call a client back because my headset doesn\'t work, that does not look good.Supposedly it\'s being pitched to the corporate market as Windows oriented, but it\'s botched for that purpose.great for your camera etc .I paired it with my Blackberry 8100 and it was simple and straightforward.The keyboard ships with a device holder at the top, but I pulled that off in the first week and have not looked back.The magnetic latch at front of cover serves 2 purposes - holds cover in place and cuts power to the screen and keyboard when cover is closed (magic).The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.'
