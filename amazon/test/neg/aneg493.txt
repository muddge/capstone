  "Great product.Caveat emptor.The vendor sent me a replacement headset after discovering the first one didn't work, and the replacement didn't work either.I agree with one of the other reviewers that it feels flimsy at first, you will be nervous about keeping it in your pocket.I cut these pads to put under the rubber furniture pads between them and the floow and no more slipping.Big difference.The construction of the headsets is poor."
