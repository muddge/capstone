  'Easily clip to something (I use the clip to keep the iPhone on my seatbelt while I\'m driving for easy access).So, after reading reviews and advice from sales people, this seemed like the best option for me.After using it for a few days, I was not impressed.you have to aim it at the grill on the right hand side.After buying the new LG Chocolate, I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it.The horizontal placement is much more comfortable than the original case\'s vertical storage.A minor point is that it "connects" to my phone (a Palm Treo 700p) when a call is placed.I would recommend this.'
