  "Good sound but.... Really good sound and anatomy, but it's hard to connect to Nokia Nseries (N82, N95, N73) that are the best cellphones with A2DP.My experience was rather random.They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried."
