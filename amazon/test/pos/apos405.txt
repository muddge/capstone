  "Works perfectly if you set the phone down, don't touch it and don't go over any bumps.Eventhough this holster does hold the phone, I've found it very difficult to get the phone in and out of the holster.or LG's Chocolate.In short, if you're just looking for a flashy, stylish phone the LG Chocolate fits the bill nicely.And I just love the colors!"
