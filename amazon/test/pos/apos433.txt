  'i think my problem might have been the wireless home network.There are several menu options you must go through before you can get to your address book when texting.I used it for a week.I have used Palm m515 for years and it recently died and I thought that was heavy ( m515 was almost 4.5oz)I have used it for 3 days only.Voice recognition is tremendous!'
