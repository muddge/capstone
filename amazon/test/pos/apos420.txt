  "belt holster.If the phone is already juiced up a bit, charger will work fine.There's also a smidge of space on either side, which I like.Not the highest quality sound (slight hiss or white noise with the volume up fairly high) but perfectly fine for everyday casual use.Wish I had bought more as backups!Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range."
