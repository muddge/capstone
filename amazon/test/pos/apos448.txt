  'Cute phone, a few glitches.The other colored skins hide the beauty of the phone.The SLVR is the best phone I\'ve ever had and I\'m very happy with it.What can you do about this?All it takes is a pocket knife or any other utensil suitable for taking a bit of plastic off the top tongue.already i\'ve had problems with the phone "freezing up."I needed a hands-free device to comply with the new California driving law.Plantronics does ask that you return the broken headset in exchange but still it\'s a huge savings to handle a replacement this way.Sony car charger.I took it home to charge it and it wouldn\'t accept a charge.I am a vibrate only guy.It holds a charge much better.Its very compact and easily fits in your pocket, purse or briefcase.great replacement.Verizon Techs have admitted to me that the antennae in the handset just doesn\'t pick up well.I purchased the phone and returned it.Great charger.'
