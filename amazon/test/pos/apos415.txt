  'You may find a slighty better sounding headset.Mine feels secure after doing this and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I can hardly tell it\'s there.I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off.My brother recommended this item because he has one.It\'s Windows Mobile...Windows uses menus.The sound clarity is way better than the Treo, as is the screen.The same thing happened in July with 2 "new" batteries that went dead in minutes.I put this product on my dashboard, and immediately all four edges curled up.My colleague and I thought, "Finally!When I went back to just using the phone, everyone could hear me sans static.When LOCKED, you are ONLY allow to use the phone with the provider\'s SIM chip.I have called people only to have them hang up on me because they cannot hear me talking.Their email:Unfortunately we do not have a driver for that device currently.The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.'
