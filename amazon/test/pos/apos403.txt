  "Works great, long charge.Jabra might be phasing them out, but this is a nice headset for the reasons above.This pouch is well designed, allowing the antenna to protrude and permitting the blinking signal light to be visible when the cover is closed.You can't go wrong.Order another from a different web site, and it worked.Amazon is a good place to buy these as we could not find them in traditional stores like Best Buy et al.Replace Item.Phone is also very hard to open without using two handsI will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear.I bought the scala-500 for my treo 650 (Cingular) phone and was rather disappointed.Have had this phone for a year but didn't use it much (got a better phone then switched back when it was stolen).Reversible plug works great."
