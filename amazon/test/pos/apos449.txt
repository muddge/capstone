  "Data cable for Razor 3VM.I dont care enough to go get new ones.Less problems.I'm considering the super glue solution.My head is rather large and they haven't hurt my ears or head at all.This one like the first one works OK when new but gets worse as you use it.I really wanted to like this phone.It has cushions to protect your phone/device so it does not get scratched.The reception is excellent!"
