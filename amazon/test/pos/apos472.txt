  "Finally got my first bluetooth headset, settled on this after to numerous great reviews.I had a Motorola H500 that was ok, but very loose fitting.I don't get any complaints from the people at the other end of the phone call anymore, and it has a good volume level that I can hear at my end.It is return only, and if you get a family plan, it is return both phones only, you cannot exchange, and their customer service is very poor.Kit includes two tools needed to open iPod case.My company recently switched from the Blackberry platform to Windows Mobile.It does everything the description said it would."
