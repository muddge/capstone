  "LOL It is textured metal so it not too slick.Highway robbery!!!But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer.They told me they don't run into many problems at all with this phone!I've called them from multiple phones, all land-lines, and they still say they can't hear you.This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel.poor quality and service."
