  "Really boxy sound, and my past 4 headsets of the same kind broke without cause.TAKES MOVING IT ABOUT AFTERTRYING DIFFERENT SIZES.It's not bad, but what do you expect for $3 or however much it is?I canceled a line.Not sure why they made it that way, but it does have a pretty long charge (longer than my headphones).Poor Talk Time Performance."
