  'Verizon\'s menu is not intuitive.I am back with Cincinnati Bell with no contract.I have been asked not to use my cellphone by Cordless phone users because it causes major static disruption)Sorry to be so negative.Cingular doesn\'t sell the "real deal" anymore (it was comfortable and very easy to get the phone in and out of) so I\'m going to keep looking.Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.'
