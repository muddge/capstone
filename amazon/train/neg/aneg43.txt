  "I just purchased Pantronics CS50-USB Wireless Headsetfor VoIP Softphones.The iGo Power product line is a great idea.Therefore its not silent recording.Works very well.A very nice phone bluetooth.. Short and sweet review here.Body Glove makes a great product.I like this phone - the reception is fine and no one has ever complained they can't hear me and I live in NYC, one of the noisiest places on earth.I could not get it to connect with any of several phones.The battery for a Motorola Razor is functioning very well and holding a good charge.I recently bought a new cell phone (Sony Ericsson Z520a) with Bluetooth.Overall best phone I've owned.I did it in 30 seconds with my Blackberry.Fell apart.I would recommend this product if it will be adaptable to your business phone.you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor."
