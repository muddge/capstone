  "Inside Secret.If you give this phone to a teen, your next bill could be monstrous from the ridiculously priced customization.6.can't they make solar powered ones?2.Volume control is kinda impossible.Claimed outstanding noise reduction and great battery life + a fancy looking charger.I tried to take the headset back to cartoys, but they wouldn't accept the return without the manual.Summary:1) Don't buy motorola.A cover that goes on the front and back of the phone!.I received the T305 on 11/26/09, charged it overnight, and it has been in use ever since.The transmitter that came with my unit was faulty and only broadcast the right channel - I also got no reply from BlueAnt's tech support.It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is."
