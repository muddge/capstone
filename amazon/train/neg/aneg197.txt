  'Now I have to go and buy Roxio or Garage Band for Mac.It is a shell game.The key might be to use your thumb on the inside of the head piece so you can control the pressure on the talk and noise button.I will use this until I find a better replacement.I had this phone at one time for quite awhile.I had to purchase a different case.'
