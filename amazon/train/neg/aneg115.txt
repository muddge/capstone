  "Initially I thought it was lame to carry around a keyboard and PDA.Good design but poor quality.It completely covers up the external jack... another example of designing something without using the actual product.I can call my relatives FOR FREE in the UK drinking a Capuccino at Starbucks using their free wi-fi access.Don't be fooled by the link for compatible phones, which advises you &quot;All phones with 2.5mm jack.&quot; Not true!!Sent the phone back in.As it turns out, I'm not.Fits Like A Glove!.While there is no chance of the iPhone falling out of it, the holder does come detached from the vent.It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset."
