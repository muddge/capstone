  "I would recommend buying a different manufacturer's phone, but if you're stuck on buying a Samsung, go with one of the Blackjack's.The Monster actually overpowered it!!!This is my first blue tooth headset.The earpiece is also easier to get on than my last plantronics set and can be done with one hand.THAT one didn't work either."
