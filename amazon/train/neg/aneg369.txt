  "basically a pro is that it's a cellphone3.Oh yeah, It seemed as if one of them was already used or at least tried.With this tiny fix, you will definitely have the best looking, best performing, and best fitting bluetooth headset out there.And where's the ZOOM???I tried several other inexpensive phones but the clarity was not there.If I wanted to be tethered to a wire, I would just use a land line...Four months later (yesterday) headset number two died in the same way number one gave up the ghost.Customer service was terrible."
