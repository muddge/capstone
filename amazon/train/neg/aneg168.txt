  'My phone is disconnected and I just wanted to download my contacts to move to my move phone.A co-worker has a Motorola Q with Verizon and is impressed with the Wing\'s features.Left my wall charger in a hotel, and wanted a car charger, too.The Hype says:"Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular\'s GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service.once I did that, the case was the perfect size, and the clip fit perfectly.The others-AT&amp;T, Lucent, Bell etc... all required a corded &quot;dial pack&quot; that attached to the headset itself.I am using a motorola V551 phone, and originally got a motorola bluetooth for it, and it was terrible.Don\'t understand the negative reviews.Adapter does not provide enough charging current.'
