  "Upon my return to the US, the only compensation provided by T-Mobile was a replacement unit.I can use it a few times then it won't work.I set the box up, but the instructions say it needs 15 feet of VERTICAL clearance between the base unit and the antenna.I've put it away in a drawer I don't plan to use it much.I'd stay away from these guys.The ear buds only play music in one ear."
