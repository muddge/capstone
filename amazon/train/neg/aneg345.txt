  'Very impressive!.I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried.Good product at a good price.Works perfect with my PS3.I recently "upgraded" from a Sony Ericsson T610 to the Moto RAZR.It was exactly what I got as described in the ad and works very well.Thank you Amazon.Best phone I have Used.The additional BlackBerry Data Plan requirement just so I can text is garbage.6.Overall though I would recommend this headset if you are looking for a wireless.Search is over!.I like the phone but I\'m still waiting for my rebate after a year.the housing is slightly split and the prongs escaped the housing but it still charges!This was a perfect fit for my phone.So if you want to look like a total geek/nerd with a giant Treo extending 2-3 inches from your waist, this is definitely the clip for you.The camera on the phone is pretty good, nothing to complain about there, and it also has a 4x zoom which is really cool.I didn\'t want two devices anymore, just one.Stay Away From the Q!.'
