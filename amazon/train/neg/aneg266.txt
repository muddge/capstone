  'The headset is loud when I pump up the handsfree volume on the phone and crank up the volume on the headset too.Does not look like the picture.At first, I thought I was doing something wrong, but how can one mess up pushing the on button.Phone Holder.Manual very confusing to a new user.Battery lasts only a few hours.'
