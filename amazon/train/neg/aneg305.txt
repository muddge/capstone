  "There's practically nothing to grip.conversations on my cell now without dropping calls.My family is very hard on earpieces and we've broken units from several manufacturers including Bluespoon, Logitech, Motorola, Plantronics and Scala.I switched from Cingular because of the ridiculous surcharges and improper billing I was constantly faced with.It does increase safety in the car.I was also told that prolonged use of this battery will ultimately damage the phone.well lucky my girl is going to get a new phone next may so i don't think it will be another samsung cheap phone.This battery is for that phone and I am so glad to find it available on Amazon.Wound up getting a replacement battery from Radio Shack which is probably what I should have done from the start, the price was competitive.I have vista so this is no good.Great phone.The computer had to be shut off and restarted each time, but when it's updated it works terrific!Not so good if you are in a crowded, noisy or windy location.Select 'Generic 105-key PC'4.Very nice, but buggy device.I find that it works fine if you follow the instructions.Dropped calls - I've owned three top of the line Sanyo phones for Sprint.However, for iPhone users, beware, no bluetooth headsets work for music due to the iphone software.I bought this because I had just bought a Motorola RAZR phone and had trouble hearing the phone.Great looking not fuctional they need to add support to the bottom of the case so it doesn't slip off.It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty.Don't buy it."
