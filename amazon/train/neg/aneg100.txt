  "I've heard this is just an issue with hard drive based iPods.If your iPod uses a hard drive and you plan on long recording, don't bother with this.When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number.When I turn the volume up the highest it will go, it does not help.I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected."
