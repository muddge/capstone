  "You'll be much happier with it.I will never buy another brand again.Of course the sound quality is cassette quality, but this product cost me only $7, so it's an excellent deal.Even with the hook, still falls off easy.It is comfortable.I really liked how it fit my ear and sounded.When your battery dies you might as well buy a new phone.Not good enough for the price."
