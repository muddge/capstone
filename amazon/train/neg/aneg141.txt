  'It\'s a hassle to send this cheap thing back and ask for a refund, but I will out of principle.I have a android phone so I bought it.Stinker for texting though.... I love my Sync!Think "limited".What products are it compatible with then, I asked?Carol\'s Review.An Inexpensive Improvement.i can wear it for hours.Moisture would get it and corrode or the display would have lines all through it or be completely blank.cable to your phone.I returned the item and will try to find another.my only complaint is that cardo does not include the silicone ear piece in the box.Everything about this product is wrong.First'
