  "The max volume of the V600 is the mid-level volume of the Razr.However, these replacement batteries have proven perfect.But now I realize what I've been missing out on.The major drawback I like the keypad a lot, much better than my previous phone's teeny little buttons.All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it."
