  "I tried 4 other cords and sure enough, the phone wont even register that they are plugged in.I think it's the exact battery that came with the Treo a 3-4 years ago.For those of you looking for a headset for 24/7 use, seriously, don't buy a headset that costs less than $20.My equipment is a Nokia 6225, I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional (SP4) and Windows XP Pro and both don't works .However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one."
