  "This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular.My old battery no longer held a charge, so I found these.Not the snazziest smartphone any more, it still works nicely for me.Thanks Amazon.Good Phone.Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems.This product is no more difficult or easy to use than other adapters.We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement"
