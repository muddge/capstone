  'The phone had to be replaced.We use a couple different cases to carry our very compact Canon Powershot camera and have never had the camera escape.The original that came with the phone offers no protection and is hard to get the phone on and off.It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.'
