  "Wouldn't let me out of contract without the BBB helping.I recommend getting that also.I would highly recommend these folks.Just what I needed for the cell phone, great price, and even better service.Top drawer.The talk time is not accurate talked for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours and 7 to 8 standby on 1 charge charged in 2 hours though.I don't understand the negative reviews.Kind of flops around."
