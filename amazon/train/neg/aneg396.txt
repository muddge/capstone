  "with my Treo 700w.It is a very snug fit, to snug I might add.I have been with Cingular 400 Roll over plans for 3 years now.This product is not well suited for my LG Vue, I am still looking for a better armband.So if I can get 2gb of memory in a storage card for under $30, why couldn't they have increased the memory?but was not compatible.. Did not work with my verizon phone and had to ship it back.The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds."
