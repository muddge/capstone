  "I would reccomend this phone to pretty much anyone who wants a camera phone.Good Hype, but weak on usability.I have mine set on loud since I use a half-hlemet and my wife prefers the lower volume in her full helmet.This is not set up for the Motorola V365.I prefer it over wearing a bluetooth in my ear by a long shot.I found this headset at a loves travel stop.Doesn't Work."
