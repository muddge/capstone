  'She did look into cingular and found out that they had roll over minutes which sprint did not and decided that should would switch to cingular.I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco, which has been the best so far.EL STYLUS QUE ENVIARON NO ES EL QUE APARCE EN LA FOTO.ESTE ESTYLUS NO ES PARA EL HTC 9100,No clicking, no losing connections.It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.'
