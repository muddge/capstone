  "If you get yourself a 100 m bluetooth adapter then u can roam around in your house and talk and hear music and even be coonected to your cellphone.The sound quality is fairly awful also.. but I'm not sure if T-Mobile is to blame or if the phone is just really bad.What are you all talking about?.This device is kinda like the Honda Accord.Very Dissapointing Performance."
