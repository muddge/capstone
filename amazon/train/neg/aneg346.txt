  "Very positive experience.While my music device was playing in made a very loud noise inside the tape deck of my used car.Accidently, detroyed my previous cell.Product works as described by Amazon and product seller.Bluetooth sounds weird,has a delay, and the battery is always going dead.It's sturdy and it works.I can't even use that side of the phone anymore.I will say that those are a challenge*The memory could be better but it isn't a big deal so far.It's not what it says it is."
