  "If you need a quick & cheap replacement battery, this would be the way to go.The sound on my end is not that great, either, though I'm willing to trade that off if my caller says it sounds ok.The ad for it sounded good.Well, I lost the phone yesterday and believe it or not, I was SOOO happy to lose it.And the user interface really makes a lot of sense once you've figured out all the shortcuts and stuff.So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended I had the old number switched to my new number.There's a joint between the main body of the unit and the panel with the buttons on it which has come apart on all three units I've tried.I tried the charger and USB cable on 3 different Samsung phones.Sending it back."
