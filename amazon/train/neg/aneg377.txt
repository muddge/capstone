  'finally, i decided to get this phone.The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit.The price from Amazon was well below retail and the unit has a sleek, polished look.All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.'
