  'I\'ve emailed ccmaccessories twice, and yet I still have not gotten word back.Ordered from SF Planet for under $10 including shipping, recieved from across the country in three days, amazing deal.And looks cool doing it.I forgot I can last a whole day on a single charge easy with a new battery.In addition it works great with turn by turn voice navigation via phone GPS feature.Your chose.God Bless you all!Go to Immanuels Temple Community Church, ITCC in Lansing,Michigan.Cheap, poorly manufactured headphones.The product I received was really bad.Recently my phone has been powering down for no reason, and I can\'t start it back up until I pull the battery.Did not work for me.The accessories it comes with are also improved, though they are tan...a little odd.Second, the negatives.I love the bumpered corners.Use it intermittently for 5 weeks.When you finally do get the clip to let go it almost always "snags" on the battery compartment button.Press the wrong button, whoops, you\'re on the internet.Well worth the small additional cost overall.I\'ve been using my clip for about two months.I bought another generic brand one and it\'s still going strong 8 months after purchase.But, that\'s just me.Don\'t buy this one!Set up was easy.Cool Funky Phone, Works Great, Awesome quality.BlueAnt X3.These batteries were a piece of crap.The fit is too tight at new.Internet and instant messaging9.Hmmmm... anyway, geat price.For the price it was worth a shot and at least I got the car charger to fit.This phone is junk.Alot of headsets are BT 1.1 or 1.2.The only downside I found is that you can\'t go through more than one wall or you lose the signal strength (1 story 2700 sq ft).This has many features.It will drop calls with all the bars showing, people are constantly saying, "What?!?The only issue that I have with it is that it doesn\'t sit very snugly in the ear but it stays fairly well.Couple of calls to customer service and for a couple of days it worked.Love the phone -hate the screen repairs.5 motorola bluetooth headsets.I got my V551 direct from Cingular for $150.00.Sometimes it wouldn\'t start or charge (and this had nothing to do with batteries or setting).Generic Cable as the other reviews state.Moto battery review.they are just about the only cases that consistently fit well, are not bulky or ugly.Except for if i am not using the built in push to talk, this makes the button on the side very annoying.The cable works fine.I want to use up my minutes and BURN THIS PHONE!So here I stand.I HAVE THE MOTOROLO RAZR AND RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS HEADSET.It is comfortable to wear.This one is an imitation/knockoff.I got the carrying case for Xmas, lost the phone on January 10.I priced it so that I could replace it and the cost was way too much.The quality of the sound, the craftsmanship and the return/refund policy definitely makes this product not worth the money.She was so excited, she had been looking for a phone charm, but couldn\'t find anything that she liked.It gave my palm pilot a very classy and elegant look.Unfortunately it did not work.'
