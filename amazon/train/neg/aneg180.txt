  "Nice phone, not much to complain.Doesn't anyone make a decent bluetooth?.This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers.I have tried all the ear pieces it came with and I cannot get this thing to stay in my ear for more than 30 seconds.I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work."
