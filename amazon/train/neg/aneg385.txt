  "service and product price.If I were working and on a conference call, I had to keep the phone on the same side of my body as the ear the headset was in.A micro USB connector version would be nice as well although the tiny Motorola Mini/Micro cable works.If you don't want these things, this phone is your best bet for the money.The static persists at any distance from my cell phone, including having the cell phone in my hand as I walk around the house.There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset."
