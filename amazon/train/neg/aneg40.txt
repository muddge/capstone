  "I have used this for about a month now and have absolutely no complaints.I've seen pictures of how they're supposed to fit -- I guess the back of the headpiece is supposed to sit on your neck.Beyond that, there were three included (separate) sets of directions on how to link the unit correctly.ear piece/ headset.I have put a request in to Motorola's website for assistance but after two days they have not answered.They claimed that T-Mobile needed more info to enter a new account.I use it with my Tuffbook at home because the rubberized keys make typing difficult.There's actually a list of the contents on one end of the box.Very unreliable service from T-mobile !"
