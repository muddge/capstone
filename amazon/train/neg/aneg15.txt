  "I definitely don't worry about the iPhone coming loose...if anything it's more difficult to get out of the case.Prosthis does not work for headset.if i hold my phone in my right hand it will sometimes start getting a week signal.I used to have one of these and loved it till it finally wore out.This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back."
