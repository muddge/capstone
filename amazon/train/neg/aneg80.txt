  'I would definetly buy this phone againIt is difficult to hear whoever you are talking to if the case is closed.3.Pretty bootleg.I just rcvd so unable to see if talk time is any better.Every day is new experience.It did not work-Price was to good to be true.You say the name, then tell it to dial work, mobile or home.Then I lost the earpiece.I am more than satisfied with the product and the excellent service.There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.'
