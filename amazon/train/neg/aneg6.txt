  "I am returning both cables and just paid the bigger bucks to purchase two separate cords from the Sprint store itself.I'm going to return it.I took my chance after seeing some bad reviews here.The difference is equal to night and day.Most wonderfulll mobile in the world... BY FAR.I have found out in that mode the bluetooth signal is more sensitive to walls than shear range.This is a nice headset and is a little workhorse as far as I'm concerned.Every time I took the phone out I almost disassembled it.Why do I give it 4 stars then?It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk."
