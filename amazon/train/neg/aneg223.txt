  "Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.Read before you buy a Treo 700p.Even if the headphones break (I stepped on mine) they can be replaced and still used with the converter/microphone.It's okay and useable, but if the camera had been a higher resolution, this would have been a 5 star device.Finally is T-mobile service.I have a V3x which took several updates before it found the phone.Super Star Blue Tooth.The battery is completely useless to me."
