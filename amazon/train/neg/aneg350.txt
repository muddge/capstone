  'When I got this item it was larger than I thought It was the size of a small video game but bulky.(I looked for one that specifically said DCU-60 and said it supported USB 1 and 2.The first time it was turned on the screen display began to flicker.In some programs clicking it is the same as hitting the return key.Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!'
