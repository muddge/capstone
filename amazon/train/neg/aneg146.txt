  'It\'s really cool!After a couple weeks of hearing complaints, I returned the 700, and purchased the Plantronics 510.I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it, it would start moving to the sides when I turned.Why the box says "Desktop Charger" is beyond me.Audio Quality is poor, very poor.'
