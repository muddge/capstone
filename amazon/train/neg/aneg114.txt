  "In some cases they are slightly off and in others they are completely off.I thought it was great for the first two minutes.Your phone sounds great in stereo, or at least with both ears hearing the same stuff.The screen is a bit washed out in high light.3.I hope I save one poor soul from this phone.The Sony Ericsson battery lasted for about 12 hours and then I'd have to charge it.This phone fit the bill perfectly.I didn't give it 5 stars because customer service with cingular needs so much improvement.I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone."
