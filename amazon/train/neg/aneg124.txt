  "It doesn't help that the button is positioned so my thumb always wants to push it.On the positive side, it's a light phone with good quality sound.And, with rumors flying around that they're going to be bought out in the near future, I will be considering switching to Sprint.The charger I ordered does not work!It worked out doors, at work, and most importantly in my condo.Was delivered on the 26th.I have no plans of switching carriers anytime soon.(I cannot believe how many people are jawing away on a cell phone while pumping gas.BARGAINCELL.it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!."
