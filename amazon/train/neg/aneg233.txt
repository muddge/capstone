  "Sure it fits the phone, and I'm sure it works as a battery, but my phone no longer fits in the clip-in belt holster that I use 24/7.If you want to keep the look and style of the Samsung Galaxy Note, this is the case you are looking for!I'm pretty tired of giving up incompatible accessories when I change phones or providers.It fits quite comfortably and sound quality seems fine.Warning - Stay away."
