  "Needless to say I didn't like the way it made me sound to other people that I was talking to.$118 PLUS MY COST SENDING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!The sound quality was wonderful.In some stores it is not even available.LG Standard Battery.I am happy to say I have not had any problems with the second.This product is a heaven sent compared to those two.First, the Ear bud is included free with the phone.Well i finally got it, The FIRST thing they told me isThe screen is much clearer than previous versions, a wonderful toy!!!The necessity of a Y-adapter just denotes a bad original design.All three broke within two months of use."
