  'I love the keypad, but I hate it!The website still lists it as \'in stock"Not a necessary accessory...but.So this will be the 2nd return.However, I have been able to pick up the specifics and choose what options I wish (e.g., answering the phone by simply opening it).Call clarity is good and T-Mobile\'s reception at my work location is surprisingly far better than Cingular.rubber cover.I switched the two phones batteries and the same thing happened.It is the only one I have found that is loud enough to be used in something other than a very quite environment.It would be worth every penny had I had to pay for it.I have been using the H700 bluetooth headset for about a week.work very well with my Motorola Q Sprint smart phone.It charges easily and re -pairs with the phone the easiest ever.It lasted a couple of months before the clear vinyl interior portions began to tear awaay from the faux leather external portion of the case.Other than that, great little phone.Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Bodyglove/Fellowes.The phone was also powered off from 8:00 PM Saturday night until 8:00 AM Sunday morning as I went to see a film and forgot to turn the phone back on.At first, the adapter worked like a charm .Just what i needed!.Remote will not work for LED color change cube.The connector was what I thought is was, the price was outstanding, and the shipping was quick.Phone falls out easily.'
