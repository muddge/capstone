  'I really wanted a case to protect the screen and didn\'t want to use a stick-on protector because of past bad luck with them.If you are a man then this is not the phone for you.Can go all day without charging for the most part -- and I use my phone a lot!Not as good as I had hoped.. This was the exact item I had been looking for and could not find in the stores where I was shopping.Using it for a headset is great also but the mic is too sensitive.Worked.. I\'m always dropping the phone and its great too cover up the window on the phone too.As it turns out, the "flex" arm is really just a piece of metal surrounded by a plastic sheath.They also said, "We don\'t support Blackberry."T-mobile, not so mobile.Ordered this for my white iPhone.The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.'
