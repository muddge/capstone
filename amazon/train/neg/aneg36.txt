  "I have only had this product for 2 weeks now so I haven't had time to abuse it, but so far it has been great!The warning on the box tells you that if you open the box you can't return it.This software is useless if it won't connect to the phone.I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great."
