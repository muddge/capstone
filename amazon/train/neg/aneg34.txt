  "I have gone through a number of earhooks, as they seem to snap just when you need them the most.2.Well made,but difficult to close.. The strap did NOT use Velcro to close.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009H7QKQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis works great, but does not come with a synch button like the original.All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola."
