  'It does not seem to hold a charge very strongly.It takes 4 hrs.When you access a new menu, for instance office tools, the phone takes a while to go into that menu.I haven\'t used all of the features yet, but the voice quality is great on both ends.fairly useless item.This unit worked great...for the 1st two weeks of regular use.It was not "unlocked" yet.I had the battery for just over a week and it is already holding a much reduced charge!This phone made me giggle with shear joy.Not a mil spec phone.eforcity battery purchase.This makes it hard to use the computer and make the phone stay connected to the computer.another lousy product.No significant improvement over the old one.Best price around!!I bought two of them and neither will charge.'
