  "for being so big, one would think it would have to be strong as well, but that is not the case with this clip.I took it back, got another one, that one lasted about 18 hours, same problem.Not pretty.The PLT 510 is completely different.Have been using it for a few months and have no problems at all.Don't buy this if you want to use the clip.And Palm's desktop software can surprise you with a feature that automatically deletes most of your old calendar entries.A case MADE for the Razr.I've been using this charger for my Sprint Centro 690 for the past 6 months after my Palm charger died.I use the headset on my way to work, on my way home and when I'm out and about on weekends - about 4 hours a day; and I have yet to charge it.They refuse to refund or replace."
