  "Not Bad but could be better.Replacement battery.. It's been a month so far of use and so far, so good.Why did I buy this phone?It does sometimes get a little static depending on where I am.I could see it even with the phone turned off.Won't stay put.I had an LG for 4 years and loved it.I have dropped it many times- still works.This is infuriating."
