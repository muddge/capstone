  "Thank You... Almost perfect.... It's so much easier to carry a cable vs another mini brick for every device you need to charge in your laptop bag.Yes, I still think this phone is ridiculas- especially for 100 dollars.Connected it to a Motorola Cliq running Gingerbread, but the connection wasn't too strong and my conversations were difficult to maintain.Disappointed with battery."
