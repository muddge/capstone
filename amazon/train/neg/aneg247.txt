  "The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.it fits the phone on the side, so that's a little goofy, but you still have functionality when it's plugged in.This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless."
