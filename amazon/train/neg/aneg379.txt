  "great phone, when bought through cingular.If you have small ears that don't stick out from your head, then this might not be the one for you.it is a smaller phone but i expected that when i got it.an AM radio station that is not quite on frequency?Plus I actually got this phone cuz I thought lost old one.Having owned two of the Body Glove Earglove Headsets, I would not purchase another one.I don't know if this happens with all phones, just mine.its always one thing after another.And it allows me to take important calls and make them while I am driving without breaking the law and with safety in mind.I wish it were a little smaller around my ear - the only reason I gave it 4 stars.Works very well with ASUS EP 121 Slate.The customer service for Cingular is the same as other companies I have tried, Sprint and Verizon.Slight scratches on it.Nice fit, no range.So I returned it.Otherwise I am very pleased with it.it's.... the carrying case is ok.!Muhammad Ali HasanThe calendar and reminders are useful4.Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem."
