  "Leather Fanny Pack.I would purchase a different brand next time.When this did not fix it, they said they will ship the new headset and I needed to return the old headset within 30 days for the exchange to be free.There are other cards that are much better.This is a great little thing to keep in your car and it is easy to change it so that it works in an ordinary older top loading cassette player.I'd be done with that seller once and for all.Piece of Junk."
