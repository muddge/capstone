  'I do a bit of remote PC support and liked the idea of utilizing a hands-free bluetooth set that I could sync with my Motorola Razr.I find myself having to hit the keys with my fingernails.Great product - installation was easy - the only problem was that I had to use alcohol to remove sticker residue from both inner and outer guards.We own a towing business and he is on his phone ALOT.Horrible phone.'
