  'the charger actually charged my phone.The actual battery model # did NOT match the image that I saw for this battery.Well, it looks like nokia have been trying out this theory with handsfree/headphone kits.When compared in size to a RAZR, it is about the same length closed, double the length opened, and about a RAZR and a half thick.I called reseller "unlockedcellphonekings" they told me sorry 90 days has passed nothing we can do.If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn\'t it.'
