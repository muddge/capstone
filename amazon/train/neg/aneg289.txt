  "The razr I have now is the last one I will ever get.Can a return it for a refund or exchange ?I got this headset for my iPhone from the Apple Store.I need to use it some times with a calling card service.Great case..nothing rough about it.Totally cute!.This was simple to pair up even though his phone model wasn't even in the manual.Samsung WEP200.Eraser works.Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory"
