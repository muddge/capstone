  "I use this headset exclusively for gaming on the PS3.Is it a knock off?Great Nextel service, pretty good phone.worked great for awhile but burned itself up within a couple of months.I have also become pretty good at putting it on with one hand.I don't know how I lived without one for so long!Good value.I have had the Motorola Razr V3 for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it.Nice unit for the price.As soon as I activated the RAZR they immediately noticed a great improvement.It got so bad that they credited me $80 or so, equivalent to one month of the service I signed up for.dont buy it."
