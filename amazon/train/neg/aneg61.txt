  "I suspect that the battery was reconditioned rather than new.I recall reading another headset's package (Plantronics or Motorola?)When I returned it for exchange, the saleperson said that's typical of this headset, and only from Motorola.It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG)."
