  "I was a little skeptical about this product until I acutally tried it for myself.cell phone battery.And I only tried one way.It came with 3 different sets of ear buds, but the length of the wrap-around piece cannot be changed.WELL....I've got 9month old twins, a three year old, a husband(!The only thing I didn't like is that the clip assembly fell apart in two days.$89.00 is the low end of these types of phones, but I think the phone works very well for the price.quick shipping~!you got your money's worth...just buy the real one, saves you a headacheGot another type with one ear piece with soft plug and it much better.Looks better than it works.I like the shape of it as opposed to the rectangular headsets.i don't yet know if this charger will fit, as i have yet to receive it.Now, I'm glad I did.Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls."
