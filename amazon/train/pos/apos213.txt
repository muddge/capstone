  "My interior is a bit noisy but it seems to work great in quiet rooms but not really anywhere else.Sound quality is always pretty bad and I get complaints from the other side also.I have a Platronics since before I got this and that works great.I believe that it is common sense that when you have a phone of this build, you obviously must be a lot more careful and aware with it.This comes with a bunch of phone adapters, but not a micro usb, the most common for cell phones so I actually haven't been able to use it yet,I've had a selection oh phones since this one and they didnt compare, so as of now I'm waiting on my new nokia 3220.press once for this, twice for that, hold 3 secs for the other, etc.)That didn't solve my cell coverage problem, but it did give me a working phone inside my home so I'm happy.All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
