  "I did this morning, but I have to pay the postage.It cost me like $200.I have had my Motorola Razor for a few years now and I would go through a new case every four or five months.This DLO case is a great horizontal case.Go to Control Panel on the N8002.Using HS850 with Moto E815 and loving it.Luckily I was able to return it and get another one because it was within 30 days.The T610 Phone gets 5 stars, T-Mobile gets 4 only for lack of coverage.H700 Blue Tooth.I believe this is a knock-off product even thought they use the Motorola model number and logo on the pouch.Inexpensive and Functional.I'm the original poster Denise who reviewed this item and I'm re-writing my original review.This looks like it would be a really great screen protector, but it is too big for the L7C's screen.The second phone does not receive any signal at all.There is no manufacture date on this new battery, so it's probably just as old as my other one.The quality of the sound of the earpiece speaker, the speakerphone and the ringer are simply the worst I have ever encountered.The keys are large enough to type easily, and it is a full 5 row keyboard.I had to go to my Verizon store to get a NEW one with this month's date code.Amazon, WHY would you do this?I got it because it was so small and adorable."
