  "I still find the processor to be annoying and T-Mobile's coverage is not the best.Sound quality is poor as well...the headsets will go back to vzw..The only complaint is that the unit is uncomfortable on my ear after a wearing for a short time.Alltel has apparently not disabled this to the extent that others have.A different iGo recharger model ($70-$100) for laptops is available and it will also power other electronic gadgets.I received it quickly and it works great!!"
