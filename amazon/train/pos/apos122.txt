  "I'll try it for a couple more days before shipping it back.On the Siemens, Panasonic and Vtech though, audio performance was marginal- it sounded like you were across the room.I had read the reviews and just hoped I didn't get a duff one like some of the others.If I could do it over, I would probably not buy this cover and just carry the player as is.The only thing it did is make my wife question my thinking!Great Value."
