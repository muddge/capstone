  'Before, my oem battery would barely last me a phone call before going empty.Its original charger was broken, so I would like to buy a charger to replace that.I need to charge it daily even after I set the packet data to "when needed".I can hear while I\'m driving in the car, and usually don\'t even have to put it on it\'s loudest setting.'
