  "I use them on a Windows XP PC and have had no issues once the software was installed.Paired up with a Bluetooth headset, I rarely have to touch the phone itself for actual phone calls; when I do, it's easy to use.This will force the unit to run off the batteries (which come pre-charged).Will order from them again!"
