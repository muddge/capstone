  'I got this phone for christmas.I did get it to work by placing the antenna outside where the signal was marginal but would support a normal phone connection.Nice Product, Poor Quality.This mount is actually great for the first two days.You have to have it directly over your mouth in order for others to hear you.The good things end there!Krussel Always good.'
