  'Not only did it quit working properly after one week.Makes it quite reasonable to pay 25 cents/minute for your first 10 minutes of the day and just 10 cents/minute thereafter.I tried 4 phones and felt noise in all the phones.The one I bought had noise level quite high and was problem with talking on phone.I wasted so much money going through so many different chargers!We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.'
