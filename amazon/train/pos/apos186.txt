  "It's been one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had with a piece of technology.The construction and comfort of this headset are fine.So I got one (also from Plantronics) that cost a little more and it works great.I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far."
