  "The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I would like it to go down a little farther on the front top and a little higher on the front bottom.the video looks good on the phone, but only medioker on computer.It's worse than nothing at all.Treo Battery.As soon as I got it, I plugged in my phone and it takes a second but starts to boot up and says phone charging.&lt;WARNING> It doesn't work with Skype &lt;WARNING>I also bought this headseat thinking it would work between iTunes and Skype.Great Range, Poor Sound Quality.Great price also!"
