  "I've still not seen a phone with an interface close to this one.Sound is great and the controls are simple.Lower per-minute rates (esp.Does not work with iPhone 3GS.The software does not recognize my phone.It looks like this phone is geared towards the young professional under 30 crowd.First the Ja-Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth.Lacks most common connection.Much handier then just a headseat.thought case was all leather but much of it was clear plastic.Nice Job By All.I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great."
