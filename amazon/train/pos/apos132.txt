  "I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't show damage anywhere, not in the screen or the functions.Plus, I was concerned my new phone would slip from my hands as well as the belt clip.I have no problems with this unit.On one set, I could only get sound out of one ear bud no matter what I did.Worth every penny."
