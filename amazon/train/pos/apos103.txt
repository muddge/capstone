  'I use my phone a lot, between calls and texts and listening to the iTunes, its unbelievable that I only really have to charge it once a day.I write "intended" because I kept the old battery and now I just rotate them.The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.'
