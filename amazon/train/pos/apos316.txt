  "The only negative is that the phone will not fit the non-swivel holster any more.After that, you're on your own.I have a BlackBerry Curve 8320 and got this keyboard to use with the device.The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first.This is no biggie for me since I never browse the web using my phoneHow on Earth can you be charged the full price that you pay every month for only 20 extra minutes that you NEVER agreed to in the first place.It is loud enough through the case.Great product and price."
