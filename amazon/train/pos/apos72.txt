  'I never got it.. The seller says they did not get paid and Amazon say they paid them on the 15th of May and its the 31st.BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.Could be better.I ordered this charger from BargainCell and received it in 3 days as advertised.Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.'
