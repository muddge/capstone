  'It reverses the polarity.Now this may work for certain cell phones headsets.I was considering t mobile but my friend michelle told me she had it for a year, hated it, switched to cingular and absolutely loves it.Great design but be careful when first using it with an Extended Battery.After messing around with it for 2-3 weeks, I finally just sent the whole thing back.Keeps auto reverse.The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.'
