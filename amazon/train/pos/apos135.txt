  "After using this headset even the bass on my car speakers is enough to bother me now, and they're just normal car speakers.No documentation or any other information was included.I bought this exact same item from someone a few months ago.As of now, I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail.I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality."
