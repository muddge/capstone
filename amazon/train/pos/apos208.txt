  'Motorola H500.Only by reading reviews was I able to clear up my issues.It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered.One advantage to this one-piece design is the superior sturdiness it affords.I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car.I don\'t need bells and whistles and I don\'t want my phone to do more than let me talk with my friends and family.So when the info on their site was bad, the charger did not work and guess who carries the bag?SPEAK UP?!?"Gripe - you cannot edit tasks with this phone, you can only change the title.Post-Its would have more stickiness.This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.'
