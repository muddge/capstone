  "I cannot put it in my cargo pants pocket and have continuous connection.I don't know how well it works for devices that take proprietary chargers (like the Motorola Q phone or those mentioned by other reviewers).The side buttons provide quick access to use both the camera and the phone itself.I love the functionality of the Treo 650 because I can do school, business, personal, and other things all on one product.ConsSo I am not in a position to compare.if that was there, this review would have five stars.Still, the enclosed USB cable is quite useful.Rapid Home Charger For Sony Ericsson.Have a 1,200 s.f.They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too)."
