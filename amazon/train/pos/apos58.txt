  "I have not had difficulty with two problems that other reviewers have encountered.I'd really recommend TuneTalk for use in a classroom.I'm waiting axiously for tuesday to roll around so i can get my new phone.That does not impede its asset of being both sych and power in one unit.It has such a weird delayed reaction!Terrific build quality, great menus and a slim form make user friendly in every sense.Good case!."
