  'This doesn\'t seem to be a new battery as they described on the site.For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with "Noise Cancelling."I wanted to get this phone because it has has walkie-talkie and ringtones and it looks fine.So I want this phone.Now, the IPOD works like new and holds a charge for hours.This would minimize background noise.Bug in the Samsung e315 phone.I wish I had bought a motorola phone.Definitely a bargain.'
