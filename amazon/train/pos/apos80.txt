  'I polished for about 2 minutes and most of the scratches were gone.The charging was complete in less than an hour and should fully charge from "empty" within 2 hours.It is a small phone, so it doesn\'t take a lot of room.Don\'t move you phone or the connection will be broken.I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.'
