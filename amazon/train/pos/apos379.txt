  "But since the phone is so thin & the release tab is fairly strong, I can't get the phone off with one hand unless I struggle with it.One thing I would recommend.I've read where some guys figured out a way, i just havent tried to rig it up yet.good but not the best.I handled it with care but it was time for battery change.When I ordered these I expected something of much lower quality.I sent them an e-mail back saying that although I would love a free Bluetooth headset I would prefer the product that I was looking for.when shopping at Amazon for Iphone accessories on check out i was informed that a screen protector could not be posted to Australia?I can't figure out why people are talking about bad reception.None of this flimsy crap like the Sony Erricson's have.Superb Phone on a Great Network."
