  "II will never buy anything else.It has been a wonderful addition to myDragon Natually Speaking.I used it in my RV.basement with bad cell phone reception.This product did not help increase recption at all.(You must be home to sign for them, and that can be a problem if you work!)5.Appears to be a quick to market first gen product.So it's more user friendly.My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great."
