  "Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.Well, I have had this phone for about 4 days, and I am planning on returning it as soon as the replacement battery for my scp 6200 arrives.Cash in your daughter's college fund and buy one today!I love all the features and form factor."
