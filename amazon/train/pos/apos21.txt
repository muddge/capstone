  'I bought these on sale at a tmobile store b/c i needed a new bluetooth and thought "wow sterio bluetooth".I bought this charger for my Pantech PN-215.I recently signed up for a two year contract through Amazon.I got the battery in the mail.Not for everyone.Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended'
