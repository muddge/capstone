  "The MP3 player in theory is nice but the headphone jack on the phone is proprietary so I can only use their headphones unless I pick up an adapter.Will it ever work?.It works, and was cheap, what more can I say.Wanting to go wireless, I read reviews and felt the CS55 would fit my needs.Iam glad to get adapter's like this for my old Sony phone.Iam very pleased with my purchase."
