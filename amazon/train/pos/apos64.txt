  "I live 4 miles outside city limits.As soon as I plugged them into my iPhone, I received an error message that the phone was not charging.It's big and bulky and seems too heavy to hold on with the latch on the back of the unit.About an hour into the trip I heard him scream that the cord was getting hot and pulled over to see what was going on.This is a great little item."
