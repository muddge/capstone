  "I bought the jabra c120 stereo earbuds because i thought it would work for my phone but it don't.But the BlueAnt Supertooth Light was not what it was cracked up to be.I never had signals going into buildings with AT&T; and the Nokia 6310i (more a fault of AT&T; rather than the Nokia).They claim to have faster service, but there were browser limitations that made it seem no faster to me that the IPAQ.I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit."
