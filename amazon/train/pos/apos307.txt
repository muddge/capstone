  "The headset worked well one of the 10 times that I tried it.While the Sony headphones are not immune to wind noise, the sound level from the wind is much lower than with the S9.GPS+phone gprs+whifi+bluetooth+windows mobile 5+..... everythink included in term of needed functionality.Not bad for the cost.It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother."
