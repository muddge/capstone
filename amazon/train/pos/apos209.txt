  'My Motorola V197 fits just as it should into the case.There is some distortion when I use the unit and people on the other end have complained about similar interference too.Great clip!.I should have read the other reviews for this item before I bought it.so for the phone I give 5 thumbs up.Most likely.The only remedy we have for non functioning headsets is replacement, if the headset is within the one year warranty.Low power battery.The image of this Lithium Ion Battery shown on the website is that of the original battery that come w/ Nokia phone.After contacting Cingular [again], they informed me that my information was now in the system, but the SIM would not respond.Made very sturdy.'
