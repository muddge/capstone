  "So unfortunately, I don't know if this headset works or not.Of course they want you to buy a larger denomination card, so they make this just good for only 15 days.The only option available is the T-Mobile melody that you hear on their commercials.If you listen to music, I recommend headphones.Update June 2011 - I'm still using this phone, and it's still awesome.Essentially I paid Technocel[price]to damage my phone.My primary interest in purchasing a new case for my Galaxy Nexus was to get one with cut outs around the buttons.I have been through 5 of these phones already, and every one has a terrible echo.Good on delivery, bad on advertising....Is what my computer said...I don't have time to be shipping things back and fourth, I'd like my purchases to last when I buy them.It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case."
