  'This model Bluetooth was the first model I ever owned...that was 3 years ago.The JAB C510 does not work with the IPhone 4 and I know the C250 does because I have one already.I ordered this product about a month ago.......didnt get it, wrote a not so great review.However, I feel the T610 has an easier user interface and is able to screen calls.The first RAZR was fine for the first 72 hrs.All in all, this phone is about the same as that one.Great product, fast shipping!.'
