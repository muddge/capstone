  "This morning, I flipped open the mic and put the thing on my ear.If all you want to do is talk and text, this phone is for you.keep it cool!Really brand new when i got it.Great little phone, although pricey.Random, next track, etc., all from the factory radio controls!Bet they won't ever offer this item as described foe $14.99.Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case."
