  "Then one day, I went to use them and the reciever crapped out.Stylish, sleek, ergonomic2.great product.I do, however, try to put it back in it's cradle as much as possible during the day to prevent battery run-down.I'm using it with Skype, Photo Booth, and as a headset for Itunes and other apps that would normally use the speakers but I need private listening.Here's the major problem and hopefully mine was defective.Product was what I wanted just did not hold up.My headset works just peachy-keen."
