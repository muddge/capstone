  'But other than that, I have no complaints so far.thw wire is very fragile and loss of sound due to bad wire connectionAt least it is inexpensive.It was a pain to try to turn on the headset and then get it on my ear.Comments like, "doesn\'t hold a charge" or "it doesn\'t let you know when to recharge the batteries" are totally false!But the major problem w/ this phone is that after a year or in my case 8 months the sliding mechanism gives out.Poor quality.. I believe the headset is a fake -- not a Plantronics.Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.'
