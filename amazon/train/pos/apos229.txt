  "Not worth the price in my opinion.The service is very reliable now that Cingular has spent money on over 47,000 cell sites in America.I'm a technically savvy person but I can tell I'm in for hours of valuable time trying to get this to work.I just hope they fix the bugs.Great product for the price!."
