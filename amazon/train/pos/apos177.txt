  "It seems that the unit can be over-charged.Recently got rid of my smart phone after realizing I really didn't need it and picked up this Ericsson.Is it worth the money?Regardless of whether I end up with something that works satisfactorily I wish I had not purchased this product.We tried the phone contact, it was down with heavy traffic, or involved a long wait.Perfect for the PS3."
