  'For dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.Sitting on the street side patio offers great people watching opportunities.$9 for potstickers seems a bit much.I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot!Way too small for a place like this, with only about five seats.Yep that is the ticket.not milk with chocolate syrup:) even though i like it too.Food was ok nothing to brag about.I do not however go to restaurants solely to be treated nicely but instead I go for the food.She asks us if we want the burgers remade.I get the number ten, eye of round and brisket pho, if you like your eye of round rare just ask they can bring it out on the side.Avoid at all cost!
