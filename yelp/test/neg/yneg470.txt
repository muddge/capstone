  "Great way to start a Sunday with family and friends.Not even close.Our food gets to the table along with my diet coke.Look at my stats.Also at the table was a house salad of sorts, which while it has potential, went half-eaten.Chicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good.Some of the highlights were the salmon with pesto cream sauce.We get our check.Come on an empty stomach.I've taken a few other new people here and they all liked it.But, occasionally, I get my hopes up for that little amazing hole in the wall.I order their honey chicken katsu which was on their specialty menu so I figured what the heck and two spam masubi.Not authentic but close enough.It was a lot of food.Food quality has been horrible.
