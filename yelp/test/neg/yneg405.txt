  "What about a bun?Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???They are a favorite of mine and will definitely be a favorite of many soon!He asked if we needed anything else and I asked for some tartar sauce and ketchup for my fries.Or watching TV, which there is none of in the restaurant.And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs?for the price, and if you have a small group, i'd recommend it.Did our server offer to bring us bread or anything since she screwed up our order and we were starving?Our server was super nice and attentive.As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times.My boyfriend ordered the Houston burger with an egg and grilled onions, also with cheese fries.BTW - I only rate the cost at $$ - very reasonably priced for the value.We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.The food is basically half of the portion of the normal size, with about half the price.Let me start by saying that I have been reading almost every review on here about this place, and have been chomping at the bit to try it.It's sad I like they're food too since it was my first job in high schoolI had blackened red snapper with paremesan encrusted red potatoes and asparagus.A large Kobe Burger fan.So, a bargain was in the making.If you are in the mood for a little change on your gyro get it spicy and with feta.Grady's still selling his famous BBQ sauce in bottles from his new storefront.The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious, as did everyone's food.It is huge and easily 2 meals for under 8 dollars.We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
