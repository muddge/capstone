  "You have your choice of 6 soups and a salad that is custom made by the servers as you walk the line.I think it is a big practical joke and the punchline is 5 years away.In the end, bad experience ruins the night and dinner.Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here.Well we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us!I have to say though, Lolo's totally came through.And you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry and angry.Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
