  'I can't say enough about the great personalized service from the food runners and hosts to the servers and management.Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their "cola" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo).They started learning our names.Went for lunch and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour pork, it also came with egg drop soup, eggroll, and a drink.My only complaint would be that the melon that came on the side was a big slice that still had the rind on it.I've seen food we ordered given away right in front of me, and then watched the new batch sit for many minutes before anyone decided to bag it up.I was starving and i wasn't craving anything while i was walking down Downtown Las Vegas.Anyways, I heard beforehand they paid about $15 per person (25 people, you do the math) and read Yelp reviews on the place.Never going back.
