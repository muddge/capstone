  "Can't wait to return!3 dishes?).No mention of beer style or hops... just darkness.They have some of the best pizza I've had.I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing.My overall experience is DEFINITELY 5 stars and I'd go back any time.I cannot believe the following message that I received from the owner of this place.My verdict?But this didn't happen while I was there.Got a small thin crust margherita, and a works deep dish with an order of jalapeno poppers...honestly, all a disappointment.If you just need a quick lunch it's probably okay to go here, but NEVER go here at 3pm-4pm.Asked if someone out sick?(~$13 for lunch - 2 sliders and super fries) They add $2 if you order the Mystery Burger as one of your burgers in the 2/$5 deal.We got there perfect timing.The flavors are so fresh and work well.The two other people that I were with ordered a meatball sandwich.Chicken & Waffles (****-Kathy's rating... she's pretty easy.Don't go if your hungry.Very, very sad.
