  "I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side, mainly because I love the stuff, and it didn't disappoint here.The Teppan Yaki with the owner is FANTASTIC.We ordered about 12 pieces.I opted for the sausage/pepperoni slice.The cheese puffers they bring in the beginning are delectable and a perfect introduction to the food.Please send me back!Some kind of yellow tail sushi roll - (2 stars).Most likely not.I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
