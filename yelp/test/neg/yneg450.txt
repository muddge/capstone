  "Delicious meat, loved the horseradish spread, which wasn't too strong, and the bread was just the right amount of crunchy.It's pho, not pad thai.Your meal comes with a variety of vegetable side dishes served in small bowls for all to share.The antipasto tray was nice.Like are you fucking kidding me.Totally awesome business in my eyes!We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
