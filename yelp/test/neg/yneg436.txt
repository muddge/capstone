  "it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me.We basically waited there so long, we could've nearly finished our meal there.I said no, will just eat it.The service was ok, the food, some good, some not so great.I like breakfast but not here.I think she had too many tables.I really really want to come back (to spy on the hot waiter) and try their brunch because that seems to be where the real magic happens!He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish.When I hand out a 5 star review, it pretty much needs to be at the top of my list in that dining category.Also, the turkey was so shredded, it was unrecognizable as such.My advise- miss the driveway and swing into Jack in the Box.I even had a manager come to the table to suggest some food items and a very good whiskey (Yamazaki.)Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
