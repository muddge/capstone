  'Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!There were tables with guests all around us, and servers were actively waiting them, but no one ever came to our table.Regardless of where I was in Vegas, there was always that questionable orange Hooters tempo smacking me upside the cornea.I noticed that they have a great happy hour to offset the dinner prices.Boy was that sucker dry!!.
