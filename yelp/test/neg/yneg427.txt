  'Your order will NOT be taken!"Good server but food is not up to par.each, plan on paying for the chips...it does state free when you order an appetizer on the menu, but seriously that is just silly!AND it did not taste like hardwood smoked bacon!After paying a $4 delivery charge, $1 convenience fee.a very disappointing buffet in such a nice casino hotel.My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
