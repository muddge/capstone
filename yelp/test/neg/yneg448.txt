  "Cool bar, but it is always really busy and honestly, I don't like any of their food.I'll be back for the home of the crown jewel of sandwiches!now if we didnt have places to be we would have gone inside and ordered our food and waited.We had the sliders, chicken strips, green bean fries, and buffalo wings.This is a five star Pei Wei, if that makes sense.Use to love this place... Service and food have gone downhill, while prices have continued to go up.Nothing special.
