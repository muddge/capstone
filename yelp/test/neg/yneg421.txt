  "You can never really go wrong at Lawry's!Unconventional!!Chips & salsa came and I'm not a big fan of the burnt flavor Roberto's salsa that they serve.For a really amazing buffet experience, I suggest the Wynn.All said though, I'll go back.Just a declaration of my experience the one day, the one time I tried it.I don't get what genre their appealing to either and what is all that weird signage crap on the walls?I can wear jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels and don't feel out of place either way.It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
