  "Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it'll do in a pinch.That said, this chain is consistently good.To start with there is salad, veg fritters and chaat (north indian snack).We've been coming here for 2 years, for breakfast and lunch.Red Devil is fantastic.There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
