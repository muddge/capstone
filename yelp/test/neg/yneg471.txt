  "Had some nefarious person stolen my dipping juice?I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits.I looked around and I thought that the dxc3xa9cor was alright, it was a little tacky but I like to have my bars a little on the tacky side.We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio.Now I have to eat salad that's not pleasant?Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
