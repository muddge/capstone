  "Great service!Bad ones too.The menu didn't look too bad though, $-wise.They have a zillion new items and it is tough to decide, but everything new seems to include mango.Taking any basic Garde Manger class will teach you that if there's salad dressing left on the plate, or in the bowl, there is too much.Great, you think.I would have sent it back but who knows how long that would have taken.Saw this place on The Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Had.I also spied a chocolate layer cake, and what?Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY.Whether the establishment has succeeded for its average patron is subject to debate.The attention to detail is unmatched down to the cucumber mint water and the music played.We won't be going back.
