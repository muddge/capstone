  "YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!!I was too full both times to try it when we went :)The menu is limited but that also means one short order cook can service the whole restaurant.The corned beef patties were good.I'm hoping my next visit will be better.It looks practically brand new.I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
