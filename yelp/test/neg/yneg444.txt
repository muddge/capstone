  'you wont be disappointed.It's a no-fuss menu with simple, homegrown ingredients in each dish.The staff seemed pretty nice, and the owner was cool and enthusiastic (which is a good sign).We don't need YOU."The 'best' part was someone at the bar says, "Hey, this isn't BS (West)" referring to the nearby gay bar.First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven!The others were great as well.The bacon/egg pizza is good as is the calimari.Exactly what we needed!However, they are ALWAYS out of my favorite item, Tiramisu.They were mostly quick to my table.The ketchup was not empty.I get at least 2 a week from these people on my door.It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.')
