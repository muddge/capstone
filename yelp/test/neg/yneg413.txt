  "While I was paying I chatted with the cashier who asked how I heard about them.And, good luck finding Slidin Thru HQ - as of 3/9/11 there is no outdoor signage.The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage.From the start of our meal, the timing of service was a combination of long waits, no explanation of the course and sub par food.In this place, who could ask for more?Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways, and obviously based on all previous reviews it went the right way.We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
