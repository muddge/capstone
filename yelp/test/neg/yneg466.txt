  "Good thing I tip in cash and didn't pre-tip... So, no refund, cannot find the number for Madison's delivery service, etc.Stopped in last night for dinner....around 7ish...so a little busy, not crazy, but steady.Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.3 Blind Moose house wine for 3 bucks.Its right near Chandler High School so it gets really crowded around lunch time M-F.In retrospect, I wondered why they sat us there.About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.I'd do better with the peanuts on the flight.Do either one of them offer to bring me fresh fluffy eggs?If anything the meat was slightly on the dry side.I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us.:-) If you're coming from the south just turn left on Oakey and then right into the Pizza Hut parking lot, it's behind Pizza Hut.When I asked about some of the dishes, they directed me away from those that they didn't think we'd appreciate.The mushrooms had very good flavor but I would have like more caps than stems.I've been here twice already and both times I ordered the bento box.Waitress was a little slow in service.
