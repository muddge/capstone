  'Even the salad was fresh and I don't think it was prepackaged, as many pizza places do.Six croutons on the side and some other "stuff".The sauce on the Pecan roll slices was perfectly caramelized from the french toast preparation and the syrup was just enough to add to the taste.Great food at amazing prices.Food was good, thinly sliced, but good.Love that they give you dough to play with b4 your meal.Will return to again and again when we visit Vegas :)If that is common, they need more wait and kitchen staff.We ordered some sushi.Cyclo has the best seafood crab soup!The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil.When we sit in the bar area, it's not as good.The service is very friendly, all the waitresses are in 1950's outfits like you would expect.The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
