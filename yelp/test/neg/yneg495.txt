  "I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being amazing and 1 being awful.My friends got the garlic chicken and they felt a little skimped on their plates.Wendy's Noodle Cafe is not like your other Chinese restaurants.I've sworn off coming here since last year and haven't been back since.Dined at the Coal Burger for the first time last night in Chandler AZ.He started to argue and be very rude to me as I was asking to see where it said I had to pay this ?I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full.It was not very crowded.Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve.$100 for 2 people and no cocktails.The bathroom was funny.Not bad, just different.My sister chose this restaurant.I went for the green one.But even though the salad came late my wife could care less about how late it was because it was so delicious.... Really liked this Burger King & will return for sure!I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
