  "Go to the register, pay, and take your dinner ticket to be seated.Our reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.good sub shop.I've never been a fan of buffets and still haven't been very impressed with any of the buffets in Las Vegas.*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place.My favorite breakfast place, Ollies Omelette House.This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!
