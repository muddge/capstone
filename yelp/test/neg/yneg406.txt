  "What deserves 3-4 stars: - The frites and classic mayo dipping sauce are absolutely delicious.Drive out of your way to find a Long John Silvers you will be way better off.However, when it arrived it didn't have grilled onions, as advertised.I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi.They run around looking so busy.. But I seriously don't see them doing anything.. And the food here is just plain horrible!No wonder this place is always packed, people are mesmerized by fire.Everything was gross.
