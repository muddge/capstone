  "Went in last Sat afternoon about 3:45.After a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well.Amongst 5 people, we managed to rent 2.If you're going to waste your product, you could have given it to us... Either way it's costing you.At the same time we never see our waitress again that night.Good, solid Itallian food.Heard a couple bad stories about a rude server there, whatever.I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.Overall, I loved the quirky Mexican decor and the staff seemed really nice.The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains.I know how much work goes into a operating a restaurant why would you add cleaning a fish tank and the expense.My 5 y/o niece is on a special diet and had just eaten so we explained that she would not be dining.We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now.But my lobster had the not so faint smell of ammonia.I would recommend it.So I proceeded to cut through the crust to check the doneness of the steak.It was melt-in-your-mouth type of meat and the portions were alright for the price.Perhaps the Olive Mill is using day old bread???It took forever to get our food so when the order finally came, we put in our second oder.They have a good options for their main entrees.I ordered take out, but really I felt it was way over priced for what I got.I have to rate their Tonkatsu Ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me, considering i eat out at least 7 meals/ week, it takes a lot to rate so high.I know I'll be making it a recent stop.The gumbo was good.The pizza was crisp but not too crisp, the crust was nice and fluffy.Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.No big deal.My son in law ordered a Bloody Mary that we affectionately called a bloody tinkerbell and the marguerita we called the sour lemonade.It was great.The service was great and the girl that helped us was very attentive.The decor is beautiful; more modern and trendy than many Pita Jungles I've been to, but in an awesome way.Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality, resembling the perfect blend of taste and presentation.The Tacos Blah!For dessert we had the chocolate tart--delicious.Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola, osso bucco and the margherita pizza.needs a good scouring.A lunch place for the blue bloods and blue hairs of Phoenix.After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
