  'the dressing tasted like it came with a kids meal at MacDonald s. What a let down.Later, I realized I had been charged for spinach, and I asked why.All I remember was lots of patchouli and eating banana chips.When they head we were planning a trip to Thailand, the owners sat down & gave us great advice!So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.I was tempted to count them but the smell of my meal to be was overwhelming so I ate instead.You will get better service at home and the decor has to be more attractive.We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night.Those burgers were amazing.
