  'Get ready to drink as they often shove vodka on you for free.The only good part about this restraunt is it is disgusting enough to cure a hangover!!!The Pluses: Great menu.One glaring thing that I always notice is that the manger never seems to be in a jovial or even in a pleasant mood and it shows.I ordered a BV blend for 45.00, and when the waiter brought out a BV Tapestry I told him that had to be the wrong one.As Peggy mentioned in her prior review, probably not the cheapest place.Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
