  "FIX has warm donuts with dipping sauce on their dessert menu!When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.Service was good and the company was better!
