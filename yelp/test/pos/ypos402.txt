  "We had rush though our meal, when we finally got it.But this drink... Oh man.I do not think that the management ever eats there, or else they would have to know that they are sub par!He said the burger was huge....It wasn't, he also said the fries were awesome!Then we walked inside... Flies!Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.
