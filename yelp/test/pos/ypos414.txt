  'We were seated with a friendly, welcoming greeting at the front of the restaurant in a nice and bright window bench.The only problem in the entire meal is the vegetables were barely warm with everything else hot.The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.A close second is the pork belly and the albacore.Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
