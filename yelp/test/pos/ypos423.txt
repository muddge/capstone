  'Came here and sat down right away.Patrick's Day in 2009.Ended up costing around $50 including tax and tip.The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.The 1-thing?I didn't like the clam steamer flavor, they had some kind of Italian seasoning on top, like oregano?I responded with "why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?"I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
