  'Decoration is much nicer than other places.They have deals for lunch.I docked a half a star since Roka is, IMHO, a tad overpriced but it is Scottsdale...On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!It was delicious though.I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths, etc the prices are higher.And there is no other steakhouse that will serve it with the perfection it deserves.The Yellowtail and tomato salad were just okay.I myself, took a nice quantity of shrimp, and except for peeling the shell, basically had a nice shrimp cocktail (on a plate).Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group.Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!
