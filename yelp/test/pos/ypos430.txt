  "and the burger/brats and beer for only $6.The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi.THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!2 great burgers hold the mediocre fries.The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away.Love the outside, great for Phoenix winters.We were promptly greeted and seated.
