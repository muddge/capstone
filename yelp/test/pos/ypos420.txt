  "While I personally would have liked to have had more cheese, they burger was good, overall.I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.This waiter was very outgoing and personable, unlike his partner who seemed a bit snooty.Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!Ordered the deluxe skillet.I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to.So I decided to check out their bathroom.The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
