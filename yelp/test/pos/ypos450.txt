  "Decent casual atmosphere.In the past I have been treated well and with respect.And don't say restaurant Mexico!I'll say this... they should seriously consider selling the chili as a chili bowl separate.Just bam, in your face.By the power of Yelp, we found something off-the-beaten-path that only the locals know about and a few tourists willing to venture out here.- Sexy cocktails - Fabulous ambiance Cons: - My trout had too much lemon and I was too drunk to have the presence of mind to send it back.The servers are friendly, but a little aloof.Both were great.The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
