  'Garlic fail number 2.The pizza looked good, the appetizer did not.So breakdown: 3 stars = Service from the girls 1 star = Food -2 stars = the cooks not getting the order right, and being pushy for us to leave.Fish tacos cames with a tiny cup of salsa.The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried.dirty floors and counters and the pop machine was leaking all over the place.Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.
