  'Wish we hadn't.I'm a fan of Hubert from TV.I'm not too big of a fan of Crabs.Where's the dark rum?If you're staying at Caesars Palace, it's always open and even during slow times, the Cafe still gets moderate traffic.Here's the deal.I should have gotten a slice of pizza because the wait was killing me.Overall I'd say they are right between "Meh" and "Good".Went here based off yelp reviews and it was delicious!When we asked the food runner about it, he said everything was "family style".If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.It was still delicious and this time I had sampled the banana and pumpkin bread.This is the first and definitely the last time I will visit this buffet.In the sitting area they have a huge loveseat that is broke down needs to be taken to the dump with it's caved in seating and filthy cloth.The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.
