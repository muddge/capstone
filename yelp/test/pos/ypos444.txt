  'which pretty much means, I probably won't have theirs again.At the suggestion of another reviewer, I chose the brisket sandwich and it was just about the most tender and fat free brisket I have ever had.Another good alternative might be Circo's big brother, Le Cirque.I'll disclaim, I'm not a huge fan to begin with of the "mixed meats" like Hot Dogs, Sausages, Bologna, Spam, etc.Is this the best sushi I ever ate?Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.')
