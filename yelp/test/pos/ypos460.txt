  "Eggs by Hickman's, chorizo by Schreiner's, other ingredients by local businesses and suppliers.We have come here for dinner in the past and for the most part have been relatively satisfied with the food.I wanted some pancakes and heard this is the place to go.we came by for lunch after checking out.All of this was great and the husband even ate the vegetables!This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
