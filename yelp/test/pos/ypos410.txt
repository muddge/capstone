  'We were about 10 minutes late, but luckily and surprising the restaurant was behind schedule.Gave us the wrong change which took a while to correct (not in our favor by the way).we saw a coyote standing near the tee about 20 yards away and also a rabbit down on the fairway.The manager that took 50% off the bill (after also charging me for food that we never received or ate) was very unatentive otherwise.So I tried it, but for me, it was all hype.go in there and get something.Delivery: 1/5.Food was great, service was great and happy hour prices were decent.Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
