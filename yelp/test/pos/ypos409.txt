  'We went here for my birthday during Restaurant Week.Plus I got two ice creams.Boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich ($5.25) and yam chips($1.99), I ordered the mushroom/halume pita ($6.50) with zucchini fritters ($2.99).Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken.On to the food stuff... Our party of 8 ordered two bowls of chips to start the evening...at $5.95 a bowl!I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception.I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.Fantastic service here.
