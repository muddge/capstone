  "famous for their 24 hour specials.But pass on the cheese board... 3 small slices for $14.Some must like it the other way around.These people , YES THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO, deserve just as much respect as the next guy.First of all, let's start with the location and restaurant.I felt like a fish out of water here (haha get it?)While Voila has only been open for four months, the good newes has spread.Open 24/7.. but you can only get breakfast certain hours.I say I would like both since you are out of the taters.The hostess was out.Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special.I read that this place has one of the best mac-n-cheese recipes in two, so we expect to return.Been to many Brazilian Steakhouse, this one is slightly different.I really enjoyed eating here.
