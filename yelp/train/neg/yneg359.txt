  'Very mixed feelings here.... the sushi is great....VERY tasty.Management at the Hotel was also condescending and of no help whatsoever.It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.Other notable mentions are the Arcadia Club, 1951 and Triple Lindy.Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.What a mistake that was!
