  "It was way too big to pick up and eat without making a huge mess, and a knife and fork just don't work for a hot dog.Apparently they deliver as well.If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal.If I went to restaurants to be treated nicely then this place would warrant at least 4 stars.On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.
