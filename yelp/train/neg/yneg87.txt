  "I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few peopleThe food is delicious.Is it really common practice to not have what you sell available?Our bartender, a friendly, attractive, Christina Hendricks-like blonde, thankfully rang up our drinks at the happy hour price.Just got back from spending the weekend in Vegas.Granted, we could have made reservations, but I didn't think it would be necessary.There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.My daughters told me about LBS @ Redrock Station.Decided to check out Ground Control last night based on a reviews on AZ Central as one of the best wine bars.. I totally disagree.Coffee was nothing special, but then, I don't go to restaurants for the coffee.No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
