  "The restaurant was open and bright and coming in from triple digit heat, well-air conditioned.My second visit was for happy hour, and this definitely blew my expectations out of the water.I had a peach carbonated soda that was really good to and not too sweet.I came after Christmas and the restaurant is half-opened.The regular fries are limp and bland, the sweet potato fries are better, but too thin.The hostess was polite and friendly and the place looked great on first glance, very classy.They aren't anything like knots.A friend and I went here yesterday for lunch and we both got screwed on the price and change.Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!
