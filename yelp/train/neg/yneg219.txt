  'So I was totally worried that Lolo's wouldn't live up to the hype.It has all the ingredients but comes up short time and again.It was initially served in one dish, as opposed to 2 in the past, and the amount of marinara was barely covered the top of the eggplant.The pretentious menu, the "Denny's" environment.If you get the chance to have Albert wait on you, it will be a pleasure.Seat promptly - then waited.(: Ordered the quesadilla appetizer.It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu ("till 11 a.m.").Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
