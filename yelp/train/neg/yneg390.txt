  "Because you people do not care !I had a reasonable amount of dinner and one cosmopolitan.Sat for over 45 minutes after placing our order without food or drink refills.I highly, highly recommend making a stop at Cafe Bellagio for Sat/Sun morning breakfast or brunch.We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
