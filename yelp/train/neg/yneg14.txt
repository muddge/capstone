  'I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside.They're really nice (but then again, what In-N-Out staff ISN'T nice?!)!I am from NC so soul food is in my blood (and on my hips!).Obnoxious--as in "over the top."Overall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.The country store has a lot of tea, cheeses, breads and veggies.The restaurant really has a nice atmosphere with the German music playing in the background and nice decorations from Germany.I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
