  "I wasn't disappointed.So we rushed through our food and got outta there since they did not want us to linger.Seasoning of the gravy was pretty good, the description said there was garlic, did not taste a bit of garlic.We sat in the dining room and looked over the menu.The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
