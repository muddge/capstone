  "The mozzarella was extremely fresh but it was overwhelming with all the tomatoes in it.All tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.It's nothing fancy, frilly or Scottsdale...it's casual and comfortable.And unfortunately, that continually seems to be the basis with which a restaurant is judged in this town.I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way.Of course, the only reason we had a menu was cause they were on the table, not because we were EVER greeted.It was a chicken stew flavored with walnuts and pomegranate.Hmm, not really sold on this as a good place to have a drink.The sea bass that my dad had was flavorful, but I'm a bigger fan of red meat.The owner said he didn't know.If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
