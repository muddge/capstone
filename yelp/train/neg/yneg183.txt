  "Ordered veal parm, got chicken.If I did return to the Marriott for a meal, it would be for the brunch buffet at Blue Sage instead.Both came with plantains, rice & beans and steamed cabbage.Don't get me wrong, they're good, but you really don't get an idea of what alligator tastes like based on this.we started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls.The server quickly arrived to take my drink order while handing me the menu.Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
