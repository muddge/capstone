  "My friends were not thrilled about their burgers.Finally after they were done taking care of him than they came to the table to ask for our drinks.Ok one more time fresh!!I'm praying it wasn't.Order Hot n Juicy sauce mild or medium.Andre's Lounge is a quaint, beautiful lounge- perfect for intimate conversation, great drinks and great cigars.lots of booth seating.If you are staying on the strip it is a butt turd of a drive.The dance floor is small, and pretty much non-existent.Vomit on the light switch?Try them out!Add to all that the selection of affordable wines by the glass and tasty boba smoothies and that's it, I'm hooked.The sushi tastes fresh and we haven't had any issues with the rolls falling apart.Drag your still-drunk butt out of bed!Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
