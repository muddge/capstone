  "She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.I was so excited to finally try this place and after the yelp holiday bazaar my friend and I were starving and decided to try it out.After all that I'm afraid we won't be going back as there are much better options in the Valley.Love this place.If you love seafood, cooked the way you like it, then this is a place for you.We were really looking forward to this restaurant.We also added the Crispy Calamari + Spicy Seared Ahi to our assortment.On our last night in Vegas, we decided to have one last meal.Standard strip prices.They were only slightly cracked.It was $6.38?!The veal Milanese was like my Grandmothers and the pastafagoile the best in town !We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.I was seated quickly in what seemed to be the busiest part of the restaurant with two large parties around me.My bean rice and cheese burrito was excellent.Maybe they just had a bad day, but we got the worst service ever in the US.The food was good and I will go back !Somone should confirm this for me!!Because that's all they need!A few minutes later our server advised that a snafu on the tickets meant they kitchen didn't get the order so our appetizers were on the house.Did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order?I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
