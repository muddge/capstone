  "Sandwich was roast beef, a top bun and a bottom bun.I am not being flippant.When my burger comes out, it looks like a puck that I just slapshotted in my hockey game!The food was just as bad, but time the service was I inattentive as well.The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.Can't wait for one to open in Summerlin!Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
