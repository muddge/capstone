  'Absolutely perfect in every way!I chose this place to have a "rest" from the steak meals that the husband required on our recent trip.Based on fellow Yelpers recs, we checked this place out on our last Vegas trip.We ordered drinks, I a soda, my nephews soda and the last a water no lemon.And by tasty i mean NOM.We ordered Cheese Crisps.Love the service.2nd hand smoke is just as bad as taking a hit yourself.The rest of the dinner a seafood pasta was just okay.I'll update when we get a chance to eat there again.My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.HB had her Udon Noodles and Edamame (these come UNsalted).. I ordered Ahi Poke (This had cucumber salad, seaweed salad and small pieces of Ahi tuna.I was really disappointed; it tasted so bad I didn't finish it and I didn't desire a doggy bag to save it.Still, it beats waiting in line for the buffet.Definitely better Thai in town.The other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time.Con: spotty service.
