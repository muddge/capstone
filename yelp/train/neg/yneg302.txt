  'The waitress interrupted me to say, "We don't make any changes to our menu items, no substitutions or subtractions."Kinda cool!I did not really find anything i enjoyed in Asain section except for the Korean BBQ Kalbi.It has managed to stay in business, and good on them.I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
