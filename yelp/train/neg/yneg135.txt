  'After we ordered I decided to check the place out.I know they had a couple different options but I am not TOO adventurous... It was a goat cheese ravioli with a very very rich mushroom cream sauce.It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt.Note: The rating and review does not include any bias on the presence of the ladies, just the food and the restaurant.-- Again, outside of the "sushi" realm, portion size could very well disappoint.Went for lunch - service was slow.
