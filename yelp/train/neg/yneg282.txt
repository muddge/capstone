  "The only problem, that was really our problem not theirs, is that they separated the bills but added 20% tip and failed to tell us that.By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30.Black bean and garlic sauce was my favorite.One who brought my food to the table.I have never tried anything here that I didn't like.My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale.There's also a mechanical bull for those into that sort of thing.If you're on the edge, I recommend this Pita Jungle for dinner tonight.Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees.This was annoying because A) my boyfriend does not eat seafood and B) its fricken Arizona people!Not as spicy as I like, but still good and definitely not to salty as some sauces like this can be.I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
