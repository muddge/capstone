  "This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in sit down area.Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.We went with the tasting menu and it was such a party on our palates!Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it.Quivey's Grove is definitely a nice Wisconsin experience.Delicious!!If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it.Worst food/service I've had in a while.
