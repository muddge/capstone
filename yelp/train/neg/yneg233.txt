  "Super Yummy.You can't go wrong.Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich, but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well.Now, it just seems old and a bit beat up.Overpriced for what you are getting.
