  "I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty!This place definitely lives up to the hype.Pluses: skewers and chopped salad with spicy dressing were good.I got 2 bowls of soup and an amazingly delicious iced coffee for my friend and I for 13 bucks!Strike 7...see where this is going?I've ordered the craw fish and shrimp with lemon pepper medium hotness very yummy, and also the hot and juicy special sauce spicy!The Yellow Pork Curry was ordered mild.The taquitos were burned, served with a lump of so so guacamole.The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
