  "I usually like to try a sampler.One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.Strikes 4,5 and 6.The beer selection is good but the prices are high.Met the owners at a different place and they seemed nice so decided to check it out.It's been more than a year since my last visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.HUGE portions.God can you give me a list of workers who make the drinks .Hey Philadelphia Sandwich Company, where's the beef?!?The main dishes are in the region of xc2xa35-8 and they have good selection of veggie dishes to.I must say I was absolutely amazed by the service.Weird vibe from owners.
