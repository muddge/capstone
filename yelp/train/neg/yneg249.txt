  "The apple & beet salad was yummy!This was a surprise birthday party for a dear old friend.We had the crab lettuce wraps, shrimp satay & mushrooms/brussel sprouts for appetizers.My southwestern burger was too gooey with cheese and green chile and pork rinds(!)Stopped in for a few appetizers and had a nice time.At $8 it's a good deal because your eating rib eye that is filled with plenty of flavor.Service was average.Pomo occupies the space formerly used by Thai Thai.i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
