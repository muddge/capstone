  "There are alot of great choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area.I think you will enjoy it.I pushed the onions to the side, and got some of the chicken.Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis.I do take out once a week for dinner.The scallops were very large, beef tender with no fat or toughness and the chicken was the same.To my surprise, I was not disappointed in the food, but I didn't care for the wait.Second, our waiter was flat-out weird.Service was friendly so no complaints there.The real disappointment was our waiter.
