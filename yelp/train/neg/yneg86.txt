  "I've had it in DC a few times, heck, I've had people bring it to me from time to time.The staff are super friendly and will take care of you.Amazingly, Yagyu's is even colder.Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food, but really, how hard is it to supply some decent food?don't order draft, those are something like $8/ea and after a bucket's worth, that gets a little pricey for football watching.It's not this guys fault you didn't hear him call your name twice because you were taking selfies at your table.Things were over-seasoned and I wouldn't order any of these things again.It's up to 5 Stars now for this great American Buffet!Every entree I have tried is great, from the Pad Thai and Pineapple Curry to the Pad Kea Mow.Food is always very fresh tasting and has so much flavor.We have no idea what made him sick but he literally broke out into a cold sweat in the middle of the retaurant.This was my first visit but most definitely not my last visit I will definitely become a regular fixture at Buldogis.A nice maybe elderly lady, blame the lighting, greeted and helped me out with the menu, lunch specials, and time it took to finish.Spend your money and time some place else.
