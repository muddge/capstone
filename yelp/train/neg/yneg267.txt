  "The food was amazing, but we will no longer be catering our business lunches with this restaurant.For $12 dollars it's a lot of food.All I can say about this is the food is mediocre, and the place isn't classy enough to be a wine bar.It's a sandwich, kids.Food: portions are big (again, better for groups!)This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
