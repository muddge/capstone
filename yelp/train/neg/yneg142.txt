  'My fav AYCE in Las Vegas!My assumptions were not wrong.Overall- FOOD: 3/5 Tasty.The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.In terms of price, quality and experience I rate Ichiza 4 stars based on what you can find in Las Vegas.Dined: 2008-07-06 After watching Ka, my brother and I wanted a late night snack.3 different kind rolls all in one plate.- Manga Burger - crab and scallop dyanmite on a 7 oz.Well, most of it.I saw no "please wait to be seated" or "seat yourself" signs displayed.Really cool.Outstanding.We ordered a som tum and got a coleslaw with raisins!The fancy atmosphere and menu ingredients will always lure in the yuppies who think they're some sort of culinary authority.once you sit down someone will bring some chips.Our first visit was for a very late lunch or early dinner.The food here is always AMAZING.The pizza was GREAT!!The ambiance isn't much better.
