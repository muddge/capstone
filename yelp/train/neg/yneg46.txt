  "A must place to eat if you are here in Vegas.Best to find somewhere else for now folks.We were promptly seated in a large booth - Dotty has some great booths... not gonna' lie.I tried it as a recommendation from a friend, great sushi, clean place, great food, great service too, plenty of parkingStill a pleasant experience, if not bit cramped (but what part of Edinburgh isn't).My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch and had the usual hour before we had to go back to work.I did appreciate though how each drink came in a mini shaker and was poured tableside.As a Floridian turned Arizonian the shrimp was pretty tasty even though it was from Thailand.Not so much that we didn't get seated right away but when we left that wasn't the case.The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy, pretty standard faire for a local restaurant.Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.Just say no to Jose Cuervo.The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
