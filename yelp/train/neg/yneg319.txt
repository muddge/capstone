  "There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station.You know you messed up my order then offer me to pay again for what I originally ordered.That rice was gone in an instant and we had to order another rice bowl.That's way too much personal info.That alone is a wonderful welcome.We stayed away from Coco's for a couple of years, due to HORRIBLE service at the 7th St and McDowell, and bad service @ the Priest & Elliot one.Awhile back Red Rock had a web site that gave me 50% my meals at various points.I've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and I finally found out at my visit to Scramble.I had the opportunity to try SOL at Monday's yelp party.Just an okay taco.I am so jealous that I don't have a Ichiza in Texas to satisfy my craving for an awesome dessert.It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
