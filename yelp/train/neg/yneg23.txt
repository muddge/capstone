  "I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.I thought there wasn't enough sauce, so I asked for more sauce, but the sauce was very thin and watery, and just lacked flavor.After the meal we let Travis know again that we would like a box for the pot stickers and that we still NEVER got our spring rolls.The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier, but the flavor was there and the sandwich was quite tasty.I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal.He was terrible!
