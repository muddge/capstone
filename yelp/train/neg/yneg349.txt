  'Time to bump up the star rating and start encouraging friends to pay it a visit before movies at the Harkins at the other end of the mall.My husband and I gave them a try the other night at Fashion Square (I had been to Tatum for drinks only) and were very pleased with our experience.I had to get the cook's name...Six.Every dish is presented beautifully with lighter fares interjected between the more flavorful ones.Good varied brunch menu.Shortly thereafter, we had two more friends join....and then two more that had never told us they were coming.So I ordered a pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni, to go.I tried their grilled pork bahn mi and two shrimp spring rolls.Order told him "we every food no onions" but still had Onions inside, The waiter like didn't hear.San Jose is too far!!Many menu options.My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.That's all you need to know right there."Got the lunch roll special to go!I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
