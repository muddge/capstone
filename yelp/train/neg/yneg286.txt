  "The reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is that the dxc3xa9cor does not match the high quality of the pizza.Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them!And we found out that the salad was never even written down.I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
