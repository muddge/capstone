  "$8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts, but I guess ignorance is bliss.My favorite was always Wednesday night soup with their Chicken Enchilada Soup, but they have changed it somehow.Amazing food, and I wish it was a little closer to me so I could go there on my lunch breaks at work.I drank 3 bottles of it..... in 2 hours.Lon's is not a bad restaurant....its simply not the excellent gem it once was :( 1) Only 1 chocolate dish on the dessert menu.But not today.Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
