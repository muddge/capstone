  "The food is definitely the best mediterranean I've had in the valley.Food was fantastic, as was the coffee.All in all, 5 dishes and 7 drinks ran us about $150.I eat at the Scottsdale Humble Pie frequently, I really think this new one kicks butt.Will not be going to this filthy place again.Great Christmas Eve dining experience.I had an absinthe and with all the fancy prep, it didn't really taste all that fancy.If they food wasn't that good here, but the service was decent, I'd even give a better rating.I would like everyone to keep in mind that most authentic Vietnamese restaurants aren't going to be very upscale and /or clean.And my favorite part: they pile the salad high.old balsamic ($31) smallish portion, good taste, but the consistency of the filling was like baby food... fail.Think about what you're paying for and demand better.I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious!Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu.Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
