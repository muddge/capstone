  "They have some new menu items that we tried out this weekend and very delicious.The hosts were from Glenlivet, Glenmorangie and Macallan.Luckily, maybe because it was late there wasn't a wait at all.My husband convinced me to give them another chance and we sat down for some lunch.We usually get one or two appetizers or hot offerings.I will, however, be returning because Grandma thinks this place is amazing, and I really think it's because of the owner.I had the burger, which was good but nothing amazing.Please let us find another boba joint that is legit for our Vegas trips!It was way over fried.
