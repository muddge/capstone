  'I will DEFINITELY come here again.Lobster was like rubber) For such and expensive dish, blah and not worth the price tag(s).No waiting at this McDonalds.The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy.She didn't try to sell us anything, talk about the craft beers, or pretend that we were helping to pay her check in any way, So we ordered.We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.If you don't know what you like- you can grab a slice of every meat to sample, then pile your plate with your faves.A manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu.We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street.People seem to love this place, but for me, I got a very "corporatized" feel from my first impression.Beware!!!!!!It was a little expensive but what do you expect for a steak house in Vegas.Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
