  'Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.The waitress must have noticed the glazed over look and smile on my face because she rhetorically asked, "so, how is it?"When I pulled up to this place, I broke my first rule of dining: Never eat at a place with more wait staff than tables with customers.We forgot to do so and they didn't have one available for us after dinner.So finally after settling into our second room we got a rewards card for gambling.Would not recommend to others.
