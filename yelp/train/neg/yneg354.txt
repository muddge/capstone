  'Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.Only good things was the salad and the cappuccino.The world would be a much better place if more people were like them.I mean, it was just "okay."The trashcans were overflowing and the floor looked dirty.We were in Las Vegas last week and went to Fatburger 2 separate times.It tasted like it had american cheese in it...strange?This was one of the worse pizza's I have had threw the store I had about 2 slices with this one thats it .I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left.I cannot wait to head back and experience the meat here.Burger, Fries and Drink super cheap.I thought to myself, "Why did I ask?It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
