  "I feel like Serendipity is one of those places that you have to try at least once when you're in Vegas.Pros: - Warm pistachios when you sit down - Fresh french fries (yes, one of my 4 food groups) - Steak anything.Just need a pickle on the side and I'm set.She took her sweet time shambling around the restaurant.As is the norm with the Buffalo Wild Wings chain, the food was great.This is my go-to spot for good, authentic, and cheap Thai food, not to mention their portions are huge!The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
