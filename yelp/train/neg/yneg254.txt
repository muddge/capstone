  "The chicken fried steak was a thin piece of steak and was overly breaded, then fried to the point it was too hard to crack the breading to cut it.Hum, I might not return again... But my husband loves the place...Their menu is just too expensive.Not too noisy and has good vibes.And unknowingly agreed to be charged an additional 59 cents.My wife enjoyed her cappuccino.Better not just because you can get the full menu and the food is good, but also because they don't often make mistakes.I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
