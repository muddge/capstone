  'The rolls were sloppily put together, small, plus they only gave you eight rolls considering the average price was about $17.First - the service was really excellent.The ranch tasted watered down also.It says on the menu "cheeseburger" but it's a double cheeseburger.We are "regulars" there and are never disappointed!And the drinks are WEAK, people!
