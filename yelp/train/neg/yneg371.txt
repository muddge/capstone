  'We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge, our main criteria being somewhere in walking distance that is "outside with strip view."The waitress apologized again, and assured us that the kitchen normally runs much smoother.Beef Brisket is good!Also the coat check is like in the very back of the club which is pretty inconvenient if you ask me.5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie.The steak was smallish and carved table side by a disinterested woman with her hand behind her back... never smiled or said hello.I wanted food like nothing else.I loved it.The worst part is I love metro pizza.for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
