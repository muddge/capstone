  "I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food.That explains the pricing; double each cost to compare apples to apples.NY steak and potato - 10 2.What I liked: The salt and pepper chicken wings.I have been going here a lot lately.I been to many many pho places in vegas.We ordered three burros (3 way, green and red I think), two soft and two hard tacos (chicken).The plus side, their service was GREAT!For me, it's definitely worth the wait.The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
