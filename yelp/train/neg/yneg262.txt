  'The dish came with most of the traditional garnishes for com tam, but was missing the traditional egg/pork "meatloaf" that disappointed me.i've stayed at better hotels in the middle of nowhere...where was our coffee maker?And to top off the experience when I was there Rick Moonen, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger were seating at the next table.The menu is huge, both in content and weight, and they have a ton of options for omnivores and vegetarians alike.I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
