  "I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club.I couldn't even look at another food after the meal we had.I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.I tried the Montague and the Caribbean Chicken Jerk.We were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains.After attending a conference all day, my friends and I were too wiped out to drive.I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients; the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about.My friend and I came here for dinner, and while the atmosphere was nice, and the service was good, the food left a lot to be desired.My friend had one of the steaks and I tried a little, it was amazing, totally melt in your mouth delicious.With better service, I would have probably rated 3 stars.I would definitely eat it again, but not with the same...smack-your-grandma-for-another-serving-gusto that I felt with the dates.The flat panels all over the place showing sports, the hearty portions - it's very manly.If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
