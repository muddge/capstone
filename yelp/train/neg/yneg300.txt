  "The television was on a novela with no sound, I'm sure it was earlier on a World Cup game but still weird.they put way too much oil which was a bummer cuz there was no rice to soak up.I've worked at a 5 star/5 diamond restaurant but have my favorite hole in the wall no star joints with excellent service and quality food.Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
