  'The decor was poor, the beer was warm, the service was poor, and the "fish fry" was right out of the frozen box.The trout was very good.Did not happen but I still enjoyed them.I did not say anything it was my guest who brought this point up to me.I haven't tried the other food items they have on the menu so this is strictly boba and shaved ice review.for what...tap water??However, they changed their happy hour to 10% off instead of 50, that I was okay with because I loved it here.Lemon curd was served in crisp cookie shells with a raspberry drizzle, fresh blueberries and a mound of whipped cream.Our server was awesome as she seemed so giddy and just happy to be at work.However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
