  'My girlfriend said she would prefer a place with more of an "atmosphere."As a third generation hillbilly once removed, I am always on the look out for good biscuits and gravy.We waited for about an hour and a half for our tables, which was understandable because they were busy and there was a lot of us.When I asked how the person that just came got a table, he just repeated that he was very busy.Just wish it wasn't in Henderson.I've never been treated so bad.
