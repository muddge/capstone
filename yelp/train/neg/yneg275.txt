  'The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty!Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.This is the second time in 2 months this has happened on different days.The dates were sweet and melted in your mouth, offset by the crunchy bacon and almonds, the sharp blue cheese, and the savory red wine sauce.You get the point.I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.
