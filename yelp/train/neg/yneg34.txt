  'I ordered their well vodka for a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was $7.Sorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review.I cant wait to try a pork pocket!It's just good.But once inside, instantly charmed.He apologizes as he just happened to be the owner (surprise).The food is mediocre and is replenished very slowly.It was a good size drink (meaning I got a whole can of red bull not just half) hard to mess that one up.Unless your into deep fried bananas,deep fried doughnuts or some boring pudding and slop serve.This definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate, and/or your date.Hands down, one of the best dining experiences in Vegas.i also asked for a lemon for my water.There's also a great big patio with heaters and a nice social bar.I hope the owner sees this and does something about it.My family has ordered a meal for a take-out a few weeks ago and the portion size was Huge and had many sides.Totally unacceptable experience we had.The little bit of the lake that we could see was, well, pretty lame.Seriously!?I had a caprese (sp?)The service was fine, as the restaurant was nearly empty.The menu looks just like cliche but the real dishes they have are fairly decent.Absolutely perfect!I asked him where the locals eat that is far away from all the dopey SEC frat boy tourists.Or risk it and order something else.There was a DJ, beer pong, ping pong, corn hole, a waterfall, and a bar.However, the seafood is not as fresh as it could be.This was when the real wait started.I think there's better service at a PT's...It didn't have a strong bite to it, but you can definitely taste it.For a fast food restaurant it took 45 minutes to get our order because they literally fix one ticket at a time.Halume is a goat cheese, which was lightly fried, but not breaded, so it was just browned.foccacia served in the cast iron pan it was baked it.If you're from another nation and want a taste of The Non-Vegan American west, stop by Big Apple fer some grub.This cafe should do very well and a nice addition for the downtown neighbors.We usually have a rice dish on the table too.From sandwiches to pastries to the better butter (peanut butter sandwich cookie) and oh oh (Ho-Ho), we devoured every last crumb.Save your money and time.Located in the Green Valley Resort & Spa!There were at least two instances where someone took my drink order, and then I never saw he or she again -- and certainly didn't receive my drinks.I am not a huge seafood person, but the ahi tuna was really good, a great "vehicle for flavor" as my boyfriend said.By far the worst dining experience any of us have ever had and it lasted over TWO HOURS.That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words.I kept seeing plate after plate brought out to my neighbors.The drinks are good, especially the Mango Tamarind Martini.The one concession made to American tastes is in the variety of toppings.I had two carne asada tacos, one chicken, one fish.The server was very attentive.You have to enter through Poker Paradise bar/lounge entrance and hang a right...My son's however was really yummy.Ribs were fairly dry with the mac n cheese and coleslaw being more enjoyable.did you tell your waitres?This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.I've been to this place a bunch of times, as I used to live right next door.tasted like sour chunks.A good place to go if you want to order a plethora of other non-Vietnamese type dishes, but if you're looking for a good bowl of pho, look elsewhere.This review is only of the cafe', as that was all I experienced.There are tons of great restaurants at the outlet mall down the street.My husband and I go about once per week and we haven't even come close to trying everything on the menu.-Waitress was a really nice girl, but the food and drink ordering was very poorly orchestrated.All in all, i like the subs and the prices were fine.In the mood for nachos?1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.Each time I've been in this place, it was empty, which is kind of sad because the food here is SO GOOD and made with much love.When the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm, the hostess took down the red rope and let us in.I think I'll just stick with the Sammy's on Sunsent in Hendes from here on out though.For two people, we were easily out the door for under $15 with plenty of food.Everyone talks about Bouchon like it's the all mighty creator of macaroons.Parking is tight, and even if you're lucky enough to find a spot in front, good luck getting out of it.Yep, it appears closed for good.JUST LEFT Kaizen.Also I had chosen this restaurant because the website says they have mariachi Thursday through Saturday.They messed up my order and would not replace it, after they initially said they would!Not impressed!That is when I stormed out and told the host up front that I had not even been acknowledged.We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out.Sometimes they get crazy busy and it takes a while to get your food but that's because everybody knows the food is worth the wait!A must do if you are in Gilbert.Luckily everything that came out of the kitchen was fabulous.We went here early on a weekday afternoon.We got in line at about 8:40 and it took up probably 40 mins to get in from the line up.Everything fresh, organic, non-gmo & most importantly, TASTY!Made that morning.Greasy chips Weird, sour ceviche No ability to do a blended drink other than their pre-made mixed stuff they keep in a slushie machine.The frog legs were incredible, I could not believe how juicy they were.Probably when I have guests from out of town and someone else is driving so I can enjoy lots of red wine while I wait.This was my second visit for dinner using a CityCoups.com coupon.This is due mostly to the fact that the vegetables had become saturated in the grease from the mozzarella cheese.I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach!I would come here again but only with my brother.Otherwise, the food was only okay.I can't usually eat that many carbs in one sitting but I nearly ate the whole plate in one sitting.The only thing "Chicago style" at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered.But now we here, lets give a shot.Meh, it's alright, but don't come in expecting a lot, because it's just fast food!Not to mention you couldn't stack them on top of eachother because there wasn't a more rigid surface on top of the container.It's not salt water.Chef: This was teppanyaki, but the chef never made eye contact with us.I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.Probably go elsewhere next time.The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil.The slices are HUGE, especially the lunch special, which by the way is only 2.99.Hit up Satori on Saturday through Mondays night and you won't leave disappointed.:-) Next time the Nutella Napoleon has my name all over it.Found it unusual that they had to find some soy sauce in the backroom but employee brought some out.China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.On the other hand, while the dxc3xa9cor is nice and pleasant - typical Jamaican with it's yellow and green walls, the place is noisy.Granted, there was ethnic variety with Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, etc.The chicken pasta salad and chicken shawarma can't be beat, and the prices are very reasonable.All in all we decided we would return.Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
