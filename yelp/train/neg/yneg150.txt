  "My last night in Vegas and after a week of attending a conference for work, I decided I'd earned a nice meal.We also ordered some nigiri and a couple of rolls.Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food.She ended up comping a drink but that did not nearly cover the almost $40 difference between the bottle we ordered and the bottle we received.The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
