  'My only concern in Brewdog Edinburgh was the staff.You know a place where you can get a steak dinner or a french toast breakfast with actual eggs at a drive thru?with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like I just spit in her face.Good times had by all.I know the female manager was just trying to do her job, but seriously tact training is required.Pluses: nada damn thing.The pork com tam we had was just a generic pork chop flavored with lemongrass and grilled.This buffet was recommended to us by one of our taxi drivers.That said, this shop is very good at what it does.The menu is nearly intimidatingly (I don't think that's really a word) large, with both raw and cooked options.Unfortunately for us, it was packed with people having a great time and taking advantage of said fantastic menu and prices.Selection and recipes of burgers are out of this world.The food was average.The bennies here are like a deep fried large pocket of air (almost like a pita pocket) with little to no crispness.Another first "cafe" that I've been to that downright told me to leave.They opened right down the street from my in laws and we are there all the time.But for the price-O MY!!!One thing about the steak though: I don't know if the steak chef is color blind, or if he simply does not give a flying caboodle.I'd give the sushi 4 out of 5.All in all, I'd rather go to the one on Rainbow and Sahara.The so called champagne toast was BS - they only gad enough for half of the guest and even came out too late with it anyways.It's not fancy, just solid delicious food.That pizza looks godsend when you're intoxicated.I would frequent this business.The biggest disappointment were the ribs.I've been traveling to different so called Hawaiian influenced plate lunch places in the area and thus far they are only 'OK'.But I found me a real strong contender if not winner!They later explained why they falsely accused us in front of other customers of trying to steal there food but no apology.Since it came down to that I'd choose the M even though its inconveniently located off the strip.Where was the flavor??I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first.We all ordered and shared our meals.The food was really good.I was here for lunch and the dining room was darker than most other restaurants are for dinner.Their Honey Brick Toast totally got me!!Oh man, this place rocked in all respects to Mexican food!Met the owner and cook....both very nice conscientious people.The food is very good.Clearly ranking among the best if not THE best steakhouse in the Chandler area.I suppose wagamama caters to local taste, but if I could describe wagamama ramen in one word, it would be tasteless.Friendly staff.My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
