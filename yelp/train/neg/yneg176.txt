  'On the plus side, the wait was much much shorter.No comparison.I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us.We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it.I do understand that is just what they do but weird.The country toast was mouth watering.We had to ask a waiter to pass on the message to our waitress.The baked ziti, was just that, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and ricotta.Service is slow, food isn't "normal" OG quality.For desert, my husband and I had 1 slice of their Very Red Velvet Cake.The decor is just kitchy enough to add to the authenticity without being corny.Way too sweet... But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.Apparently it is rocket science to address this.Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
