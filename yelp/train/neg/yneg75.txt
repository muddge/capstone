  "I'll let you know how it goes....Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.Redemption!!You have to go up to the counter to order food.This is the ultimate heavy hangover food and, although they could've dialed down the spice in the sauce, was tasty.It helped the time pass.If I was in the area I would go back.Pub Crawl, stop 2: I have been to The Library a couple of times and like it.For breakfast, we always get pancakes, the wrangler and a muffin, and share between two adults and a toddler.i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me.There wasn't much eggplant left, and what eggplant was left didn't taste much like eggplant.The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
