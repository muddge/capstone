  "That's a shame too, because it's a great space.Not only ours, but we smelled a couple more burned attempts during our meal.Soooo tasty!Beer is definitely the way to go if you are drinking.Had just eaten at a couple high end restaurants (the Sage notably) and had the worst service ever and had to pay for it.I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite.It also states they hav 10 years experience.The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
