  'The coffee was also just as delicious, a great mild blend.We went in and the staff was really friendly m it was very clean and they have a bar on the other side of the dining room.It is a little pricey for lunch though.My last review still stands!!!!I ordered Pho Ga (#17) and had it within a few minutes.Tons of speed bumps and messed up lanes and directional changes.Though the staff was friendly, and fast.The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple.Terrible management.
