  "The Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you.Okay so I have been on a crazy ramen kick these last few weeks.Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?I really enjoy eating at this place.. the food is always good and the wait staff feels more like family.I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.Nearly the entire time.I was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger.She said something then I ordered too based off what I saw on the machines, I just wanted something fruity.Sure beats the Pho spot I was contemplating inside T.I.Wow after having a LONG night of boozing and partying with the girls we stopped in for lunch before we got back to reality.Portion size is on the smaller side.A truly caring owner.it was a drive to get there.
