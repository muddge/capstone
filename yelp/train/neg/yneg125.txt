  "It's not hard to get this wrong.We also ordered sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and sauteed brocolli.*MOUTH DROOLS* The lady up front is very nice too and I liked that they had tables outside!This could possibly make you skip back to my car after having one or two or three!He really is a great people-person.For dinner they include two different sashimi orders on their All You Can Eat menu.All that said 3 of us was $ 130.00 of utter slop.The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.Is it part of the French attitude?Discuss.....The server greeted us at our table with a fresh house made bread selection of onion, olive bread and rustic chibatta loaf.I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
