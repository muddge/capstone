  'Our waiter generously offered to move us to a table on the other side of the patio, which worked out perfectly.Both meals were very hot and had lots of good flavors,the french fries were not store bought and cooked just right non-greasy.I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.You can spend a good amount of time playing pool or watching sports on one of the 10+ flat screens.He got a bbq burger instead, he ordered fries but was given the cold soggy wedges also.I'd never heard of it, and was excited to try it.I had a combination plate with orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup & a fountain drink Mr.Well you all lived up to the rumor....the hostess was very rude and unprofessional.She offered up anything on the menu to replace it instead of my money.The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.This place is a must see for any out of town friends or family, but put it on your "favorites"list.It was kind of sad.It texts you when your table is ready.We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita, wise guy and sonny boy.I have been to this place dozens of times, even way before I started Yelping and checking in to places.Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
