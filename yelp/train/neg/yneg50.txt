  'I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty.She came over to us and said that she was sorry but "athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant."The service was extremely slow.
