  "Their pizza is alright and cheap but we won't be ordering it when we're in town again due to the bad service.We ordered from Joey's instead -- 4 pies and an order of garlic balls.It's family owned, and has been running successfully for 30 years now!That being said, the food makes up for it.I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area!Our meals were delicious and made up for the not so good appetizer.Service here is quick and they speak a multitude of languages.What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
