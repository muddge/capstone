  'Of course he was, they were zucchini.Only food here though.The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc.And of course overpriced for the quality and quantity of good though reasonably prices compared to the other Bellagio restaurants.I do think it was a tad over cooked but completely bearable.I would not recommend this place.
