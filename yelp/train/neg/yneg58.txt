  "I went for lunch.The wait time between courses was not paced weil.Keeps shit edgy.If you go, I promise you will like...You know it's a good thing when there's a lineup, constantly throughout the day.Sit down and wait 10mins for server or anyone to approach us.Never had a heard a good thing about this place, I went here on a Wednesday night with some friends because I wanted to check it out.Our server seemed very rushed and distracted, but at no point in time during our meal was she bad enough to really make us take notice.Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer!This is a disgrace.
