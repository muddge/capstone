  '(place was packed).Pesce: MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO- You can never go wrong with this fish.Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys.It's nice lil spot for people watching and you'll see a lot ;- /It seemed, "like-pretty good".Overall if the food was cooked better the way we wanted it I would rate it higher.A co worker was in town and he was try to fine a reasonable steak house "Bulls Eye".The waiter suggested a mimosa, and the meal was on.She was a very nice, slightly older woman.How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
