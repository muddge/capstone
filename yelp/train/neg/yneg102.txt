  "It gets better.The biscuit was flaky and huge.My advice would be to sell the expensive string wrapping machine, and spend a little money on some plain old take out lids.Next time we're in downtown Vegas, we will be going to the Triple George Grill.It was pretty much that.I brought my daughter to the family restroom and there was no soap on the soap dispenser.I told the server of the problem with my filet and sent it back.Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.The waitress seemed confused when we asked her for water for everyone.I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
