  'Some people will probably be irked by this, but I enjoyed it for the places it lets my mind wander.I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.Most diners are oblivious, we are acutely aware of the skills required.I think I would give this place one more chance and update my review.The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap.Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
