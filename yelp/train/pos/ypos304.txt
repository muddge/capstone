  "The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience.I went here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything went pretty smoothly considering our group's size.Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.You have to eat here when you have time late at night and are craving some Japanese flair.I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
