  'The Manager should not be allowed to talk to customers or be on the floor.It is GINORMOUS so I would definitely suggest sharing it between at least 4 people.There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station, but the price is a lot cheaper than grocery store sushi, and the quality is much better.Didn't have Bohemia beer (hello, is this a high-end Mexican restaurant, amigo?).Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy, and they aren't exactly supersizing everything.And on top of this experience, the waiter tried charging us "FLAMINGO WATER" $4 for 2 people.Not really a great impression.The egg on the croissant had a crusty edge , but yet egg was cooked over medium as requested (pan was too hot).Pretty standard mac n' cheese, but with a delicious baked crust on top.The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
