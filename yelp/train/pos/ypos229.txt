  'Simply amazing taco salads and smothered burritos.You offer sweet potato fries?she had to come get you 3 times!!!I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant, it is a way to "upcycle" or use something old in an innovative way.They advertise on their to-go menu, "IT'S THE BEST, HEALTHY, ALWAYS FRESH!".Ok, it really doesn't extend out that far... but it sure does seem like it.Daughter's steak was apparently chewy.The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
