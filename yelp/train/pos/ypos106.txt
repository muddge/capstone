  "I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks.( tasteless).i am a vegan who do not like fake meat.We will give it another try since we live so close by.We never had to ask for water.The dish also comes with just the right amount of potatoes.I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here.Finally, our salads arrived.The place has a nice set up but the food was amiss.We took it to go.It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
