  "They did bring out nice thick homemade tortilla chips to munch on with a great chipotle salsa.It was a great spot for lunch with coworkers and our tummies were all happy from our meals.Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good.The servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)After learning my lesson from my first trip, I placed an order online for a Jack Daniel's Pecan Pie and Chocolate Cream Pie for Christmas.just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess.It's a shame too.Food was alrightI love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!
