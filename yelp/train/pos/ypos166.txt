  'My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous.A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.Very strange place.Would go back for drinks or with a date who was footing the bill.Also found this place on Yelp, and Yelpers were very helpful again.Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
