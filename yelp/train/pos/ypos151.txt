  "Lobster roll and oysters!Swiss cheese, ham and a beautifully done fried egg.I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer.All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.
