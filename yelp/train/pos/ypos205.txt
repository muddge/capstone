  "Pity that I overlooked that when it mattered!It's hard to find Chinese food cooked for Chinese and not the american palette.But fret not, my friend, for once the goods are placed before you, you can't help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it.A manager came up and yelled at the poor hostess in front of us.They're busy at lunchtime.The food is okay, but the server wont refill you until you ask.A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
