  "The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar.I mean, c'mon, isn't sriracha Chinese hot sauce?Horchata was wonderful and felt like I was actually having one, but with shaved ice.Oh yeah, the relish plate for your fajitas?The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.Serendipity on the go is definitely not on the go.This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.
