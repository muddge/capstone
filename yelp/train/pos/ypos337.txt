  "There were three urinals lined up with no partition, one urinal was off to the side with a wooden wall.I could not thank her enough.FINALLY, we were settled and began ordering our drinks and food.We started with appetizers.I had about $5 worth of food.I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.It felt very NYC (as I learned later, it has a sister restaurant in NYC).Entree...I ordered the 9oz filet medium well.The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.
