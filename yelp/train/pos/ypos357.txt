  "Bread was hot.And don't forget to add the fish sauce and any of the multitude of other sweet, savory, and spicy sauces and pastes, Sriracha included.11:55 - Finally got seated.It is a nice bar/ restaurant to watch sports in.and surely not worth the $40.00 plus a tip bill.They also put an obscene amount of basil leaf on the pizza, which fortunately was not as soggy because most of it burnt up into a flaky black powder.All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.You've been warned!The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
