  "Had my first fish taco but most important they sell roger's mexican mooon shine.It's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff, but does not win my vote for best pizza in Phoenix, sorry!We took a seat out front which was nice and had a view of the bar.You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(But the waiters must have been recruited from Applebees!We loved the biscuits!!!
