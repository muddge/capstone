  'I was honestly more excited about drinks and dessert, so I didn't order an actual "meal."They came with chorizo which was minced and sprinkled over the mussels.The chicken madras, vindaloo or hurri mirchi are my favourites however this is one of the few places I have enjoyed the milder creamier curries from.This plate is so big you can easily split it w someone.So I ordered a regular ketchup and all I could say think was I want some Heinz dangit!We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead.I'm not sure if it's even open for business.All the bread is made in-house!
