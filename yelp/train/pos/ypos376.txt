  "To mtop it off the drinks were over priced and the performance was crappy.I think it's a obvious mistake, though.Would give an extra star for fixing any one of those issues, two if all were fixed.And the pho is much better when it is served fresh.I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.
