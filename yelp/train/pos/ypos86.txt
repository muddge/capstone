  "I walked in around 4 on a Saturday, expecting it to be empty which it was, with that said I would of expected better service for sitting at the bar.So we knew we had to go.The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely.it even left me with a stomach ache the rest of the evening.This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.
