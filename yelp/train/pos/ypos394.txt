  "We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders, and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund.I love coming here for a late night snack... carna asada flatbread & a stella~!I love the Western theme...they didsuch a good job!The blueberry muffin I had to go with it didn't hurt my feelings either.I just wish they would open a place near the Biltmore where I live.Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.
