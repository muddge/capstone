  'Being it December, I decided on coming back to have another Beef Wellington since it seemed like the perfect meal for the holidays.i'm actually going to get some togo tonight.I wasn't paying attention and wow!From reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a popular brunch spot.Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!
