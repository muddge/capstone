   Baked Scallop Shell (Not bad at all, oily of course as they usually are, but apparently not as oily as the Dynamite, but it was tasty.I definitely recommend this breakfast spot, but be prepared to wait awhile.... it is popular for a reason!If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.Mmm tequila.It was exactly that.Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar.The owner is nice and, though a little hard to understand, will talk to you as he prepares you food.This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
