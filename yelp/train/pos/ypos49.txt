  'I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places.This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time.Their "cheap" breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns.It didn't have the rubbery chewy texture but was actually juicy and tender like eating a seafood steak.However, I do remember my experience there.I noticed that the table next to us got their food a lot faster than us.Come early (8am) and beat the crowd.We finally had to ask a different server who got the manager for us.Also, our waiter who looked and sounded like Boris from Bullwinkle was really nice and very well informed :)For the price (about $50 for my wife and I @ the Sunday brunch), I expected a lot better food and service.I have been coming to this location for quite some time now, and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had.Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY!I said "Excuse me, hers should be free I believe, that would make 11 meals total."The decor of the place was great with a perfect view of the kitchen so you can see them prepare your edible art.This is how a local pizza shop should run a business.Kinda made me regret coming here for dinner when it did was nothing to brag about.The whole place is one giant freezer.This one is definitely a diamond in the rough.Wait, hear me out, please?mmmm... cardboard parmesan.Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
