  "I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept.Line was long as usual.(It was 8pm on a Saturday.)If I didn't drop a minimum of $20 on every visit they'd definitely get 5 stars.The food was good, we probably would have returned if it was not for the horrible customer service.It was completely empty inside but what do you expect for late Sunday lunch time?On the left side of the restaurant were about 4 bar tables with stools.I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
