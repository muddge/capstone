  'There were tables outside, as we left someone was smoking there.You need to make a reservation at least a day or two in advance!I guess they were in a hurry even though the place was 2/3 empty.Line system is a little ridiculous - different lines for different meats - which makes it a pain to try different meats.I was expecting more exotic French foods.The pulled chicken and pulled pork were a bit bland, but not too fatty.The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
