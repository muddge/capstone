  "The happy hour on Friday is great, lasting till 9:00 pm which is unheard of.Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona.I had dinner here 2night on the way home from walking my dogs and, never having eaten here before, wasn't expecting anything much.So the food was decent.We were served a basket of artisan bread and each ordered the prime rib, medium rare, along with asparagus and a baked potato.I can't wait to go back.
