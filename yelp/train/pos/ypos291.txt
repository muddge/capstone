  "The luxurious, filling pho that I always enjoy at Da Vang was replaced by a bowl of broth and noodles.Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM.Gentle Strength moved to a new location recently and this has given them lots of room to stretch their wings.I mean literally flaming.Would have been five stars but the price to portion ratio was a little high.Great food.
