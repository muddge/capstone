  "The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).Yelp, your mobile app has taken me home again!I will be back soon !The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.Probably because it's in a friend's neighbor hood, and it's a bar, and i lied about it being little.The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.
