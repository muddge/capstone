  "Happy Hour is awesome and the Cucumber Martini is terrific!When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.I've had pasta salads from supermarkets, italian markets on Taylor St.This is not your regular DIVEY Vietnamese joint.The screaming orgasm was decent.I've been craving a Taiwanese beef roll since getting back from LA.We walked in at 8, two hours before close, and one hostess was hunched over the counter doodling.This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza.It wasn't all out.CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
