  'How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste.I'm torn between 4-5 stars but I'm feeling generous.(Which is practically all of them..) I know its their "signature" flavor, so there isn't much else to say here.We came here for lunch before driving back to Sacramento.The rest of the meal and salad was OK but nothing to write home about.I ordered a steak burrito and got chorizo.Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
