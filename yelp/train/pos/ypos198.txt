  "Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations.It is vegetarian and vegan but I wouldn't exactly call this health food....still a healthier option than most.I'll still go there because the food, drinks and service are great, but I'm wondering who else got sick?Actually no I wanted some clean dang tacos.The structure of the tower with beams and rivets adds to the decor, and feeling of being transported.It had a cool vibe to it, and cool wall hangings and lighting, so my first impression was pretty good.I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
