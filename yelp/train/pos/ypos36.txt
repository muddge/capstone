  "I didn't taste it, but I saw the plate.I've eaten here occasionally for years and always thought the food was good, especially the crispy honey chicken.Whether servers are new or not, if they are not ready to be on the floor, there should be more training before they're working on their own.If I owned this place after working so hard to make it what it is with that beautiful smoker and exterior scenery.What a great double cheeseburger!
