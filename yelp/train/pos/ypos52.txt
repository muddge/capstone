  "I just had them toss it out.We started off the night with a country pate that was made on-premise with seasonal ingredients.I ended up eating the grilled cheese, mac & cheese (YUMMY), fried chicken, and wings!But hey Ezekiel's I will be back again and again and again.Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.There was hardly any spinach that I had paid extra for due to the confusing menu, and I couldn't even taste the Dorito topping.Everything we have tried thus far has been awesome.For serious, though, this place is cool.I had the seafood one tonight and it was very tasty and extremely filling.Once we arrived there was a mob scene of about 30 people waiting outside and the wait was an hour.I've dined here three times so I know the drill.I love this place.
