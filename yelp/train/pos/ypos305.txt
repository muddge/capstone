  'The restaurant does have a nice glass faxc3xa7ade, which allows a pleasant view of the street.Why would someone ever take Kobe beef, and completely ruin it?This place is pretty dang good.A weekend of pure indulgence to say the least.Was it worth it?I will admit, my first visit here probably biased me rather severely towards this place.They went ALL out on this.My girl friend and I split one, so did her grand parents and her dad had his own.For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.
