  "Spring rolls are delicious but small.Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!On the downside the sushi that came off of this menu was unappetizing and the chicken katsu was the best thing I had that day.My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages.The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
