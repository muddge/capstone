  'I asked for a steak knife - which it should have been served with.I live in Henderson, and commute to work as I must, I now wake up on my days off and gladly make the drive to try something new.I only ate 1 bite, and the shrimp itself was tasty.Cheese is good friend of mine.Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.
