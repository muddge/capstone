  "I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and got the thai chicken pizza instead.I WILL continue to go to the original S.T.3-7pm Otherwise pry wouldn't go!So I'm staying at Caesar's Palace and they have a Central there.Tonight I sat at the bar and chatted with the beautiful and friendly bar staff.I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.
