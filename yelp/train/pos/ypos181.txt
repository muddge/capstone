  "Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.Wow they loaded them with cheese!!We strolled in here one day for lunch and ordered a bunch of stuff off their menu.And you get a lot for the price.I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices.While the wait staff is still friendly and works at the same speed they always have, the wait time for food itself has increased ten fold.Sashimi salad consisting of salmon, ahi tuna and albacore 3.The grilled vegetables were good, although I don't know that I would have ordered it if I knew there were parsnips and brussel sprouts.It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars, but maybe next time I come by I'll have a more attentive waiter.I ended this incredible adventure with my favorite, Creme Brxc3xbblxc3xa9e, and again....perfection.Great Guac.Just a great evening for not knowing about the food there.Then she made a mistake in our order.I was here for a business meeting and the nachos were just horrible!There are a few all you can eat places in LA that are both good and well priced i.e.the one thing i distictly remember is having to drunkenly sleep up on the A/C because it works so poorly.Good food , good service .
