  "Pancake was WAY bigger than I thought and kind of regretted getting now since I couldn't finish it.Thai Orchid's menu offers a vast choice of authentic Thai dishes.I guess if you're eating here, you don't really give a shit about money though.Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
