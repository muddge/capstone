  "It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time.They didn't even have to make anything for me.No room for dessert.I've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood.Can't wait!But this place is just not good any more.Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!
