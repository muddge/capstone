  'I'd looked the bar up and their website made it look quite nice inside.This is a typical waiting for food activity, is it not?Then came the piece de resistance that I was waiting for the most: a 12-oz.I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well.Wasn't really happy with that, but I'm sure they have their reasons.This is near my work and I drove by it all the time thinking "I should go in there."great food--not the same old, same old stuff.The bass comes with head and bones - accidentally swallowed a small bone, and I'm used to eating fish that way.Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.
