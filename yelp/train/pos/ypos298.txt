  "The packaging needs improvement.No complaints about the service, and the veggies in the limited salad bar were fresh enough.Good luck having a conversation at a normal level.The food was good but not enough for me to go back again.They obviously did the restaurant.com deals to drum up business (it was nearly empty in there) and that is how they treat us?Both rolls tasted very 'fishy' which should never be the case.Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake.Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
