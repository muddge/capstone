  "So, here's what I did.I'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy, when we asked about eating there.I am lucky to have a partner who likes to share meals so we can try more stuff.and I do not mean your regular lettuce, with dressing and croutons etc.It's nice inside, with comfortable booths, as well as just right lighting, temp, & service.Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
