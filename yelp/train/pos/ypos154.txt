  "Looking forward to some original chicken, while hubby wanted a double downer.Had another delicious meal here again.The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.We entered on a Saturday just before 6pm.So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated.Try Feast Buffet at Red Rock.Sorry Bollywood, catchy name but nothing to back the great time and food I thought I would have.Sure it's a little better than Elis Island but it's 8 Times more money!These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
