  "That said, I think my expectations of pizza are rising with age.I also love the sandwiches, but the bread was a little hard for my taste.When we pulled it it looks like some crummy hole in the wall pizza place.The only reason someone should ever go is for the entertainment factor Dick's is famous for.Fourth, our other friend had ordered his burger with wholewheat bun but was given a honey oat bun and, when asked, was told that it was wholewheat.Would I go there again?I had a buddy of mine pick it up for me.If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi, be prepared for the horrible customer service that comes with it.I LOVED it!
