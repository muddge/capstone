  "No mention of the half of the drink order that we had to ask someone else for.80s music played along with their music videos on one wall.The flavor would've been pretty good if they hadn't put so many crunchy noodles in it.Kids eat free on Tuesday!I drive up to the window and they tell me they are out of beef!?Double double, protein style, animal style!As they say here, 'I love Sushi' and I live this place!So we were looking for something different in Tempe.Service is quick and friendly.
