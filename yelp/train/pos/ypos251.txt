  'That is not a normal wait time for a diner in a business area for lunch.We met people form Indiana, Denver , and Brazil jus to name a few that was staying at the hotel .#ERROR!Cannot beat this espec.The cheeses did not present itself in a natural progressive order along the palette leaving conflicting flavors fighting over oral real estate.Walked in & waited a good couple of minutes while he chatted with co-worker about the previous night.I can think of any number of places I have been to that are just as nice.I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.
