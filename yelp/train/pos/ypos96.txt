  "I would definitely come back here again, this time sober.However, that menu is not cheap...$18 for the nachos!Have been here a few times for lunch.After hearing it was our first time they gave us samples of all the types of meats.Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos, he thought they were dry and were definitely missing something in there.Guess they don't see a lot of that in here.I feel like the waitress was a little disappointed to see customers walking in.The hangover was like tamale with pork carnitas very different & good flavor big portion.there was a funny smell in the place when we walked in.Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.Everything was good.I've had worse, but I do expect some kind of crispness.I have eaten here before but not in about a year.We had about 5 of us, that ordered a variety of food... probably totalling over $200.and sorbet were delivered.Service: The servers are hard to understand.Always a pleasure dealing with him.
