  "I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items.I've eaten falafel in every city, but this was the show-stopper.The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus.So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.To our favorite Chicago Steak house restaurant readers, your eyeballs will pop out of your heads with dismay.I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.$8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.I will be returning!Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
