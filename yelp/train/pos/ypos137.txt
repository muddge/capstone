  "It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.She didn't like it at all, saying it was flavorless and was left yearning for a cannoli from Whole Foods (Ray/101).I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.And even though they only take cash, that doesn't bother me one bit seeing as how they manage to keep their prices really low.The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!
