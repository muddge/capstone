  'They also agreed to some of my special requests... so.We've had China Mama on our list for a few months and finally made it over there last week.When it initially opened I gave it three stars.Very similar to Ted's in Tempe.The Bun Rieu is in the $9.00 range but the flavor and ingredients are top notch.The standouts for us were the "Monkey Cakes" which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter, very yummy!You won't be disappointed.
