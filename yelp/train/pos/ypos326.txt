  "Then I proceeded to order the Duck Lo Mein.Service was also commendable.The food is good so the fun vibe is just icing.I like the vegetarian cheese burger but I don't eat cheese so I ask for it without the cheese.Every time we go to Vegas, we make sure to hit this place up at least once for breakfast.In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.
