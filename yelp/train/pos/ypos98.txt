  "I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.I read these reviews and went anyway since I had a restaurant.com coupon.The staff are the stars because they provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for your meal, very attentive but not at all overbearing.That might've been it actually.The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
