  "There is an occasional line (confirmation of good food) but the wait is never that long.Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle, ad hoc accents all over the place.Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts).last night my friend picked up some pies from this place and we inhaled them in just a few minutes (3) pizzas for 8 dudes....took us about 7 minutes.This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.
