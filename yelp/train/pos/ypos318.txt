  "The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too.Super disappointed with a recent experience to Bouchon Bakery.They have a bunch of gigantically garish pillars of flame.For the price I don't even think I would be back.Nothing amazing here.Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.So all you aspiring Mesa Grill patrons, ask yourself this: are you ready for a Let Down?The waitress and manager are so friendly.
