  "Gave them two hours advance notice we had a party of 20, still waited 25 min.They are worth the $$.What's all the hype?The Garlic Garlic Shrimp had 9 good sized shrimp with the tails on served on a bed of raw cabbage.The upkeep of the interior could use some work.I initially said I wanted to get the all you can eat and then asked leaned that most of what I wanted to order was on the a la cart menu.Alberto was fun and made great martinis.The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.
